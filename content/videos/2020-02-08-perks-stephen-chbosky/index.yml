  I heeaavviillyy skated over the actual plot of this book because I was so whisked up in my memories of it; I didn't mean for it to sound so whimsical and positive; it's very angsty and abuse is a big topic in the book; but still, at one point they were all infinite.

  And in that moment, I swear we were infinite
