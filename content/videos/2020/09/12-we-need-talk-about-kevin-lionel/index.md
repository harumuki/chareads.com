This is an entirely spoiler-free discussion. When I finished it I was so keen to talk about what happens in the final pages but I don't think it adds much to or changes much about my takeaways from the novel. What's up with the tiny clothes?! I still haven't been able to wrap my head around that component. 

p.s. I haven't figured out the AE-lock on my new camera yet, I apologise for the jumpy exposure.
