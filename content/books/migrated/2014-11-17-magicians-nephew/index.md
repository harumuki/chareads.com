summary: |
  The secret passage to the house next door leads to a fascinating adventure.
  The Magician's Nephew, the first book of The Chronicles of Narnia … where the woods are thick and cool, where the Talking Beasts are called to life … a new world where the adventure begins.
  Digory and Polly meet and become friends one cold, wet summer in London. Their lives burst into adventure when Digory's Uncle Andrew, who thinks he is a magician, sends them hurtling to … somewhere else. They find their way to Narnia, newborn from the Lion's song, and encounter the evil sorceress Jadis, before they finally return home.
  Read by Kenneth Branagh
