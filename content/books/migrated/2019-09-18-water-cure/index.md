summary: |
  'Eerily beautiful, strange [and] unsettling' Paula Hawkins, author of The Girl on the Train
  'Bewitching' Guardian
  'Calmly devastating' Katherine Angel, author of Unmastered
  You are a girl. Your body is vulnerable. Men will break it if they can - and out there, they absolutely can.
  Suffering will prepare you for the worst. The cure is nothing compared to what you've been spared in the sickness. It takes a lot of love to hurt you like this.
  Now, come outside. It's time to play the drowning game.
  Imagine three sisters raised on an island, taught to fear the outside world and its men. And imagine the men who come to find them: three strangers washed up by the sea, bringing desire and destruction in their wakeâ€¦
  'A work of cool, claustrophobic beauty' Eli Goldstone, author of Strange Heart Beating
  'Eerie, electric, beautiful. It rushes you through to the end on a tide of tension and closely held panic. I loved this book' Daisy Johnson, author of Fen
  'Creepy and delightful - it has a pinch of Shirley Jackson, a dash of chlorine, and an essence all of its own' Rowan Hisayo Buchanan, author of Harmless Like You
  'Otherworldly, brutal and poetic: a feminist fable set by the sea, a female Lord of the Flies. It transported me, savaged me, filled me with hope and fear. It felt likea book I'd been waiting to read for a long time' Emma Jane Unsworth, author of Animals
