summary: |
  Dickens's epic, exuberant novel is one of the greatest coming-of-age stories in literature. It chronicles David Copperfield's extraordinary journey through life, as he encounters villains, saviours, eccentrics and grotesques, including the wicked Mr Murdstone, stout-hearted Peggotty, formidable Betsey Trotwood, impecunious Micawber and odious Uriah Heep.

This was delightful. I found it so much more charming and warm than the other Dickens I've read, and it reminded me what long books can do - introduce you to a whole host of interwoven characters that feel like old companions by the end. The wretched were wretched, and the beloved were so beloved.
