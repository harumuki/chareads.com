Karen, an attractive, popular student, goes into a coma one night in 1979. Whilst in it, she gives birth to a healthy baby daughter; once out of it, a mere eighteen years later, she finds herself, Rip van Winkle-like, a middle-aged mother whose friends have all gone through all the normal marital, social and political traumas and back again… This tragicomedy shows Coupland in his most mature form yet, writing with all his customary powers of acute observation, but turning his attention away from the surface of modern life to the dynamics of modern relationships, but doing so with all the sly wit and weird accuracy we expect of the soothsaying author of Generation X, Shampoo Planet, Life After God, Microserfs and Polaroids from the Dead.\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2015-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","2015-03-18T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":3,"rating5":3,"pageCount":281,"dateRated":"2015-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2015-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Douglas Coupland","image":{"id":"5699f51d-e92b-5a98-a029-b6378b20779f","childImageSharp":{"id":"fd0b0d65-e010-5671-8281-9c7ea7e8b6d1","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.66,"src":"/chareads.com/static/976db59981fe9caea9013649a26df548/5515f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/976db59981fe9caea9013649a26df548/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/976db59981fe9caea9013649a26df548/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/976db59981fe9caea9013649a26df548/5515f/cover.jpg 264w","sizes":"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px"}}}},"html":"<p>I was really enjoying the narrative in the beginning, but then it flipped into pseudo-philosophical, paranormal preaching which didn’t feel inkeeping with the mood.
