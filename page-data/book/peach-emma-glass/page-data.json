Staggering around the town streets in the aftermath of an assault, Peach feels a trickle of blood down her legs, a lingering smell of her anonymous attacker on her skin. It hurts to walk, but she manages to make her way to her home, where she stumbles into another oddly nightmarish reality: Her parents can't seem to comprehend that anything has happened to their daughter.\nThe next morning, Peach tries to return to the routines of her ordinary life, going to classes, spending time with her boyfriend, Green, trying to find comfort in the thought of her upcoming departure for college. And yet, as Peach struggles through the next few days, she is stalked by the memories of her unacknowledged trauma. Sleeping is hard when she is haunted by the glimpses of that stranger's gaping mouth. Working is hard when her assailant's rancid smell still fills her nostrils. Eating is impossible when her stomach is swollen tight as a drum. Though she tries to close her eyes to what has happened, Peach at last begins to understand the drastic, gruesome action she must take.\nIn this astonishing debut, Emma Glass articulates the unspeakable with breathtaking verve. Intensely physical, with rhythmic, visceral prose, Peach marks the arrival of a visionary new voice.\n","tags":[],"readDates":[["2019-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","2019-04-12T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":3,"rating5":3,"pageCount":null,"dateRated":"2019-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":null,"dateReviewed":"2019-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Emma Glass","publisher":null,"bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"efa63c88-99de-5868-9703-a5cac0310579","childImageSharp":{"id":"bc399869-74db-5d90-8591-6c6dce50c010","h200":{"width":126,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/358134edf037d70779fde8bb764a8fac/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/358134edf037d70779fde8bb764a8fac/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/358134edf037d70779fde8bb764a8fac/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/358134edf037d70779fde8bb764a8fac/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":190,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/358134edf037d70779fde8bb764a8fac/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/358134edf037d70779fde8bb764a8fac/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":253,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/358134edf037d70779fde8bb764a8fac/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/358134edf037d70779fde8bb764a8fac/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#EE5B34","darkVibrant":"#7A220A","lightVibrant":"#F48454","muted":"#926052","darkMuted":"#44444C","lightMuted":"#BB9A8D"}}},"html":"<p>I feel distressingly ambivalent about this.
