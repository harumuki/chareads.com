Clay comes home for Christmas vacation from his Eastern college and re-enters a landscape of limitless privilege and absolute moral entropy, where everyone drives Porches, dines at Spago, and snorts mountains of cocaine. He tries to renew feelings for his girlfriend, Blair, and for his best friend from high school, Julian, who is careering into hustling and heroin. Clay's holiday turns into a dizzying spiral of desperation that takes him through the relentless parties in glitzy mansions, seedy bars, and underground rock clubs and also into the seamy world of L.A. after dark.\n","tags":["sub-ennui","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2011-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","2011-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":4,"pageCount":195,"dateRated":"2011-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2011-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Bret Easton Ellis","image":{"id":"10319329-cc2e-5cc1-aafe-ec7120299ff4","childImageSharp":{"id":"3bb20a3c-a459-54e0-bc0b-15546bd7bdd8","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.66,"src":"/chareads.com/static/33db6e709ef976d0896df80a4ab2cf9a/5515f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/33db6e709ef976d0896df80a4ab2cf9a/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/33db6e709ef976d0896df80a4ab2cf9a/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/33db6e709ef976d0896df80a4ab2cf9a/5515f/cover.jpg 264w","sizes":"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#FCF404","darkVibrant":"#833955","lightVibrant":"#E537A3","muted":"#5C5C64","darkMuted":"#40222D","lightMuted":"#87125B"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"0bf7b288-a90f-53d6-9071-a53ed8bac664","title":"My All-Time Favourite Books","datePublished":"2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-06-my-all-time-favourite-books"},"timestamps":[{"t":45,"book":{"id":"0f87a9ee-fbba-556c-89c5-a9115ce7b978"}},{"t":155,"book":{"id":"40db6ade-6bd2-5592-a6d3-56cb5f98facc"}},{"t":251,"book":{"id":"7d3db2cc-1af6-5dff-af29-18a602892fb8"}},{"t":1990,"book":null},{"t":380,"book":{"id":"f6a3045f-b7c9-52fa-b2c6-168bbff749b7"}},{"t":547,"book":null}],"image":{"id":"7e9a187d-d0b9-5602-8947-910b4ae6a172","childImageSharp":{"id":"b17561e6-2553-5b24-ae28-4c4186bffb34","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/4802ed23a22abadcc31c2d3cbcf256a3/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/4802ed23a22abadcc31c2d3cbcf256a3/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/4802ed23a22abadcc31c2d3cbcf256a3/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/4802ed23a22abadcc31c2d3cbcf256a3/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/4802ed23a22abadcc31c2d3cbcf256a3/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/4802ed23a22abadcc31c2d3cbcf256a3/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/4802ed23a22abadcc31c2d3cbcf256a3/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#CD9734","darkVibrant":"#6D3030","lightVibrant":"#C4E4F8","muted":"#797689","darkMuted":"#473035","lightMuted":"#D1B3BA"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"f6a3045f-b7c9-52fa-b2c6-168bbff749b7"}}}
