A man who calls himself the vicar visits, hoping to extract a deathbed confession. He wants to know what really happened that fateful summer of 1969, when Frances - tasked with surveying a dilapidated country house - first set eyes on the glamorous bohemian couple, Cara and Peter. She recalls the relationship they forged through sweltering days, lavish dinners and elaborate lies, and the Judas hole through which she would spy on the couple.\nWere the signs there right from the beginning?\nOr was it impossible to avoid the crime that split their lives open like rotten fruit?\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2019-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","2019-08-09T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":3,"rating5":2,"pageCount":280,"dateRated":"2019-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Claire Fuller","image":{"id":"09d29ec1-9d20-5d64-b0b9-93cb37e84d2a","childImageSharp":{"id":"aa0d6fa5-e741-5f2f-894e-a8af9529690a","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.62,"src":"/chareads.com/static/392457a95a45212ca73e20c9b54677fc/9b6ef/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/392457a95a45212ca73e20c9b54677fc/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/392457a95a45212ca73e20c9b54677fc/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/392457a95a45212ca73e20c9b54677fc/9b6ef/cover.jpg 248w","sizes":"(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D49D2F","darkVibrant":"#27594E","lightVibrant":"#F4E4AC","muted":"#868A7D","darkMuted":"#264646","lightMuted":"#B0C0B5"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"5225ac94-59ba-5cf5-9c8e-6c1d32d7a627","title":"August Reviews","datePublished":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-09-august-reviews","viewCount":722},"timestamps":[{"t":16,"book":{"id":"a5ae62a4-11b0-5a4f-a319-b1cfd23d2ddc"}},{"t":255,"book":{"id":"0b6b9d69-ce1c-5be0-ad42-bd5a6513a72c"}},{"t":417,"book":{"id":"b1d2b3ee-fe61-570a-ba89-3bb8e18b8c1e"}}],"image":{"id":"7f2dd9dd-ece7-5bbf-936e-2d0ac51d8ff3","childImageSharp":{"id":"efd453d6-d8b4-5d58-816a-c9122ea81c15","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#6CC4F4","darkVibrant":"#A2942C","lightVibrant":"#81D4F5","muted":"#5C86A8","darkMuted":"#4F2C2D","lightMuted":"#ACB2C2"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"a5ae62a4-11b0-5a4f-a319-b1cfd23d2ddc"}}}
