Her life is regulated by schedules: prayer, sleep, study, prayer.\nWhen Nigeria is shaken by a military coup, Kambili's father, involved mysteriously in the political crisis, sends her to live with her aunt. In this house, noisy and full of laughter, she discovers life and love - and a terrible, bruising secret deep within her family.\nThis extraordinary debut novel from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, author of 'Half of a Yellow Sun', is about the blurred lines between the old gods and the new, childhood and adulthood, love and hatred - the grey spaces in which truths are revealed and real life is lived.\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback","translated"],"readDates":[["2018-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","2018-11-24T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":336,"dateRated":"2018-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2012-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie","image":{"id":"33f9fc45-e294-5c13-91af-ccc4878a340d","childImageSharp":{"id":"d3fa8a84-1698-5f50-a837-1dd3360df97c","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.65,"src":"/chareads.com/static/b3d3e947854989325c91d6b5e9825bd4/90e08/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/b3d3e947854989325c91d6b5e9825bd4/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/b3d3e947854989325c91d6b5e9825bd4/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/b3d3e947854989325c91d6b5e9825bd4/90e08/cover.jpg 260w","sizes":"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#E41C64","darkVibrant":"#621B34","lightVibrant":"#D48CB4","muted":"#6BA3AA","darkMuted":"#5C364C","lightMuted":"#B4C4C0"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"421d35e7-b835-5bb1-91a4-91845063d964"}}}
