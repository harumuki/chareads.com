Her life is regulated by schedules: prayer, sleep, study, prayer.\nWhen Nigeria is shaken by a military coup, Kambili's father, involved mysteriously in the political crisis, sends her to live with her aunt. In this house, noisy and full of laughter, she discovers life and love - and a terrible, bruising secret deep within her family.\nThis extraordinary debut novel from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, author of 'Half of a Yellow Sun', is about the blurred lines between the old gods and the new, childhood and adulthood, love and hatred - the grey spaces in which truths are revealed and real life is lived.\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback","translated"],"readDates":[["2018-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","2018-11-24T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":336,"dateRated":"2018-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2012-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Chimamanda
