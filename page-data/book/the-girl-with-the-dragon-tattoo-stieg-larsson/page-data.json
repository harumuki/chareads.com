Her body was never found, yet her uncle is convinced it was murder - and that the killer is a member of his own family. He employs journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the tattooed, truculent computer hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate.\nWhen the pair link Harriet's disappearance to a number of grotesque murders from forty years ago, they begin to unravel a dark and appalling family history. But the Vangers are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves.\n","tags":["form-audiobook","genre-contemporary","genre-crime-mystery","type-fiction"],"readDates":[["2014-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","2014-03-15T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":17,"dateRated":"2014-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2009-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Stieg
