But at some point between page three and fifteen--it's page thirteen in Kafka On The Shore--the deceptively placid narrative lifts off, and you find yourself breaking through clouds at a tilt, no longer certain where the plane is headed or if the laws of flight even apply. Joining the rich literature of runaways, Kafka On The Shore follows the solitary, self-disciplined schoolboy Kafka Tamura as he hops a bus from Tokyo to the randomly chosen town of Takamatsu, reminding himself at each step that he has to be \"the world's toughest fifteen-year-old.\" He finds a secluded private library in which to spend his days--continuing his impressive self-education--and is befriended by a clerk and the mysteriously remote head librarian, Miss Saeki, whom he fantasizes may be his long-lost mother. Meanwhile, in a second, wilder narrative spiral, an elderly Tokyo man named Nakata veers from his calm routine by murdering a stranger. An unforgettable character, beautifully delineated by Murakami, Nakata can speak with cats but cannot read or write, nor explain the forces drawing him toward Takamatsu and the other characters.\n","tags":["type-fiction","form-paperback","translated"],"readDates":[["2017-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","2017-06-08T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":3,"rating5":3,"pageCount":505,"dateRated":"2017-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2012-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2017-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Haruki Murakami","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"4f699805-7692-57e2-b22e-0c2a79ac7f51","childImageSharp":{"id":"9ef71a13-3412-58d2-8d5d-60eb91015de8","h200":{"width":129,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/9bec762ea7fb270cf446ad58f05c2ac0/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/9bec762ea7fb270cf446ad58f05c2ac0/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/9bec762ea7fb270cf446ad58f05c2ac0/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/9bec762ea7fb270cf446ad58f05c2ac0/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":194,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/9bec762ea7fb270cf446ad58f05c2ac0/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/9bec762ea7fb270cf446ad58f05c2ac0/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":258,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/9bec762ea7fb270cf446ad58f05c2ac0/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/9bec762ea7fb270cf446ad58f05c2ac0/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#CB0C2C","darkVibrant":"#641220","lightVibrant":"#F88296","muted":"#847C84","darkMuted":"#392127","lightMuted":"#DAD8D8"}}},"html":"<p>This took a downward turn for me about half way through, I feel like the flagrant Murakami style was a double-edged sword.
