With nowhere to call home, they instead embarked on a journey: to walk the South West Coast Path, a 630-mile sea-swept trail from Somerset to Dorset, via Devon and Cornwall.\nThis ancient, wind-battered landscape lays them bare, stripping away every comfort they have ever known. With almost no money for food orshelter, carrying the essentials for survival on their backs, they wild camp on beaches and clifftops. Until slowly, with every step, every encounter, and every test along the way, the walk sets them on a road of discovery. They don't know how far they will travel, but unexpectedly, they find themselves on a path to freedom.\nThe Salt Path is an unflinchingly honest, inspiring and life-affirming true story about coming to terms with grief and the healing power of nature. Ultimately, it is a book about home, and how it can be lost, rebuilt, and rediscovered in the most unexpected of ways.\n","tags":["on-loan"],"readDates":[["2019-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":4,"pageCount":275,"dateRated":"2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2019-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Raynor
