With nothing left and little time, they make the brave and impulsive decision to walk the 630 miles of the sea-swept South West Coast Path, from Somerset to Dorset, via Devon and Cornwall.\nThey have almost no money for food or shelter and must carry only the essentials for survival on their backs as they live wild in the ancient, weathered landscape of cliffs, sea and sky. Yet through every step, every encounter, and every test along the way, their walk becomes a remarkable journey.\nThe Salt Path is an honest and life-affirming true story of coming to terms with grief and the healing power of the natural world. Ultimately, it is a portrayal of home, and how it can be lost, rebuilt, and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n","tags":["on-loan"],"readDates":[["2019-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":4,"pageCount":288,"dateRated":"2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2018-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Raynor Winn","image":{"id":"e438c92d-179d-517f-bfec-2873ffc50aaf","childImageSharp":{"id":"f41cb277-7533-54a5-abbb-172ce2213c34","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6225,"src":"/chareads.com/static/797eedec40d413d19a33fd467910d9e5/5f486/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/797eedec40d413d19a33fd467910d9e5/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/797eedec40d413d19a33fd467910d9e5/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/797eedec40d413d19a33fd467910d9e5/5f486/cover.jpg 249w","sizes":"(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D5BC2A","darkVibrant":"#6F6216","lightVibrant":"#F8F4DC","muted":"#747C77","darkMuted":"#464B41","lightMuted":"#D1D2BF"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"adc4623a-c723-50a4-96ce-44646d3450f8","title":"June Reviews","datePublished":"2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-06-june-reviews"},"timestamps":[{"t":7,"book":{"id":"97e9fba3-cd3e-5841-84ed-b4c678de5e2e"}},{"t":118,"book":null},{"t":288,"book":{"id":"59838099-3474-57d4-a07a-c64778b94cfb"}},{"t":502,"book":null},{"t":820,"book":{"id":"21188a1c-4712-50a2-ae13-ff42db2aaba4"}}],"image":{"id":"acc9738a-99e9-5b73-bac9-e3448096ffa0","childImageSharp":{"id":"fe95de84-2134-5841-89c0-fab0641cad74","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#28389C","darkVibrant":"#6B2F36","lightVibrant":"#CEDEEF","muted":"#7E6975","darkMuted":"#2B3249","lightMuted":"#BABCC5"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"97e9fba3-cd3e-5841-84ed-b4c678de5e2e"}}}
