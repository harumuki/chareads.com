The universe, that is. Now only five individuals stand between the white killer robots of Krikkit and their goal of total annihilation.\nThey are Arthur Dent, a mild-mannered space and time traveler, who tries to learn how to fly by throwing himself at the ground and missing; Ford Prefect, his best friend, who decides to go insane to see if he likes it; Slartibartfast, the indomitable vice president of the Campaign for Real Time, who travels in a ship powered by irrational behavior; Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two-headed, three-armed ex-head honcho of the Universe; and Trillian, the sexy space cadet who is torn between a persistent Thunder God and a very depressed Beeblebrox.\nHow will it all end? Will it end? Only this stalwart crew knows as they try to avert \"universal\" Armageddon and save life as we know it, and don't know it!\nLENGTH 5 hrs and 47 mins\n","tags":["genre-science-fiction","form-audiobook","type-fiction","sub-space"],"readDates":[["2014-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","2014-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":6,"dateRated":"2014-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2006-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Douglas Adams","image":{"id":"a75f10f4-c938-572b-a5f7-b90fcac10003","childImageSharp":{"id":"7a3959e9-7b48-5131-9e58-a5196f3e9c88","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6075,"src":"/chareads.com/static/95746d3c1174800b6ce1eed98a72bbae/29f84/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/95746d3c1174800b6ce1eed98a72bbae/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/95746d3c1174800b6ce1eed98a72bbae/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/95746d3c1174800b6ce1eed98a72bbae/29f84/cover.jpg 243w","sizes":"(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"438d40a1-1389-5186-9465-212a9dc024ad"}}}
