Reluctantly agreeing to marry Mrs Haze just to be close to Lolita, Humbert suffers greatly in the pursuit of romance; but when Lo herself starts looking for attention elsewhere, he will carry her off on a desperate cross-country misadventure, all in the name of Love. Hilarious, flamboyant, heart-breaking and full of ingenious word play, Lolita is an immaculate, unforgettable masterpiece of obsession, delusion and lust.\n","tags":["genre-post-war-classic","form-audiobook","type-fiction","translated"],"readDates":[["2014-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","2014-03-23T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":5,"pageCount":304,"dateRated":"2014-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2010-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2014-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Vladimir Nabokov","image":{"id":"f45c1c87-9bf9-594e-9551-a184243f6fe3","childImageSharp":{"id":"ba272849-c4d8-5317-9cc8-6afadc92ab08","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.65,"src":"/chareads.com/static/f60ac57a237b308a6190bec5cae9259d/90e08/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/f60ac57a237b308a6190bec5cae9259d/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/f60ac57a237b308a6190bec5cae9259d/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/f60ac57a237b308a6190bec5cae9259d/90e08/cover.jpg 260w","sizes":"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#DC1B5E","darkVibrant":"#741C2C","lightVibrant":"#EC9CC4","muted":"#8C686E","darkMuted":"#444440","lightMuted":"#CA9DA7"}}},"html":"<p>Video review/chat/expletive on Chareadzard</p>"},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"abe5cf05-a8d9-54be-8b61-1cde142146a5","title":"Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov","datePublished":"2014-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2014-03-lolita-vladimir-nabokov","viewCount":6501},"timestamps":null,"image":{"id":"5b5970ba-4e31-56d5-9c9c-cc78f068c191","childImageSharp":{"id":"07b91981-b8de-58b1-82a6-b6776ea7b08f","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/48ea3ee4fa7c1e870b6ea58493e46659/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/48ea3ee4fa7c1e870b6ea58493e46659/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/48ea3ee4fa7c1e870b6ea58493e46659/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/48ea3ee4fa7c1e870b6ea58493e46659/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/48ea3ee4fa7c1e870b6ea58493e46659/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/48ea3ee4fa7c1e870b6ea58493e46659/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/48ea3ee4fa7c1e870b6ea58493e46659/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#E9BC66","darkVibrant":"#283F65","lightVibrant":"#EC718E","muted":"#8F7E71","darkMuted":"#5B4C36","lightMuted":"#ADCBDA"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"554bec99-bd90-5e9c-920e-79200972eecd"}}}
