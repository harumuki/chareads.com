In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.\nThe Ego is the Enemy draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history. We meet fascinating figures like Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.\nBut why should we bother fighting ego in an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion? Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, “you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you’ve set out to achieve.”\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","form-audiobook","sub-business-productivity"],"readDates":[["2018-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","2018-07-29T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":3,"pageCount":226,"dateRated":"2018-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2016-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Ryan Holiday","image":{"id":"90609516-ebf6-52f7-ac2f-52372ee77e2d","childImageSharp":{"id":"afc489f9-3053-51aa-8de5-d01e0e22ddb9","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.7069767441860465,"src":"/chareads.com/static/c736b4e81286e06b11481e270f40dd7f/7e972/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/c736b4e81286e06b11481e270f40dd7f/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/c736b4e81286e06b11481e270f40dd7f/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/c736b4e81286e06b11481e270f40dd7f/7e972/cover.jpg 304w","sizes":"(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#3C6C8C","darkVibrant":"#044464","lightVibrant":"#A2C2D7","muted":"#537C8E","darkMuted":"#4C4441","lightMuted":"#A4C4CC"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"8678bebb-ac42-5f90-a1a2-7fbc6b450633","title":"33 Book Reviews","datePublished":"2019-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-03-33-book-reviews"},"timestamps":[{"t":78,"book":{"id":"b5fe70fd-ed14-50b8-80e0-e6db20601a67"}},{"t":125,"book":null},{"t":150,"book":{"id":"43ce85f9-c6e3-5b2a-bcb0-33eb7713c915"}},{"t":171,"book":{"id":"051066fe-5835-5a75-b21d-a55b4818fc8c"}},{"t":299,"book":{"id":"daa16512-2aca-59da-9969-6bb709b2b062"}},{"t":386,"book":{"id":"31e13483-b155-5c30-a587-e094ce60c3ca"}},{"t":465,"book":{"id":"66f87cba-5dbc-5b0c-a0a7-2c831ff9aa51"}},{"t":548,"book":{"id":"b0577604-f211-5926-8595-d3ff86f5df5c"}},{"t":621,"book":{"id":"d20f4a5f-2661-50b2-87d2-cdf55cf41e6a"}},{"t":648,"book":null},{"t":708,"book":{"id":"b1d2b3ee-fe61-570a-ba89-3bb8e18b8c1e"}},{"t":880,"book":null},{"t":955,"book":{"id":"87c58dcf-9323-5899-8729-af0295b12b41"}},{"t":980,"book":{"id":"efa156cd-b54b-5932-bade-0ede5ec248da"}},{"t":1095,"book":{"id":"cdc2c507-d384-52d2-adbe-0bb03bb2b635"}},{"t":1212,"book":{"id":"80a6e125-a89a-5882-b64f-d81ea3f4b259"}},{"t":1368,"book":{"id":"4bbb46fe-9dc3-5436-8d0b-627650d37501"}},{"t":1449,"book":{"id":"8a14becf-0353-5ddc-9a1a-75a2ba66d1f0"}},{"t":1579,"book":{"id":"cdcc1b2c-3f71-5c03-bb70-264f0c9a27c8"}},{"t":1655,"book":{"id":"330900b9-9421-5068-9aa0-e5ad79e40480"}},{"t":1715,"book":{"id":"1e08e04b-d63c-54fa-891b-3c742461ea11"}},{"t":1795,"book":{"id":"7085fc31-ff01-506c-b459-2d7a3e62639d"}},{"t":1829,"book":null},{"t":1913,"book":{"id":"1adb5115-a7f0-51f8-8910-2b11307a604c"}},{"t":1974,"book":null},{"t":2106,"book":{"id":"88938e06-0394-53b4-8e0e-47635bf7f892"}},{"t":2311,"book":null},{"t":2556,"book":{"id":"d7d2b03c-aa29-5ee2-b222-16ebbe4ba0ff"}},{"t":2545,"book":{"id":"0e3b0150-7f4e-5dcd-8e82-c932dbfc9528"}},{"t":2784,"book":{"id":"35a86c1b-32e4-5ae1-8c44-a2f5a01652c2"}},{"t":2868,"book":{"id":"0cb3a5ee-8217-5efa-96bb-2db9feba2900"}}],"image":{"id":"4e91d5b6-fc17-5e48-8a8e-ec923157917d","childImageSharp":{"id":"90d35327-888f-5cf8-b0f6-fd7cd22abe65","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#E15C60","darkVibrant":"#552E11","lightVibrant":"#EB8385","muted":"#8F776F","darkMuted":"#5D3F35","lightMuted":"#9DC2D1"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"43ce85f9-c6e3-5b2a-bcb0-33eb7713c915"}}}
