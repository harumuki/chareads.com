Here, he painstakingly documents a world of unrelenting drudgery and squalor - sleeping in bug-infested hostels and doss houses of last resort, working as a dishwasher in Paris's vile 'HÃ´tel X', surviving on scraps and cigarette butts, living alongside tramps, a star-gazing pavement artist and a starving Russian ex-army captain. Exposing a shocking, previously-hidden world to his readers, Orwell gave a human face to the statistics of poverty for the first time - and in doing so, found his voice as a brilliant writer.\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2014-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","2014-04-19T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":4,"pageCount":216,"dateRated":"2014-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2013-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2014-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","author":"George Orwell","image":{"id":"4b100482-04da-5185-9fd3-2ea44fec90ab","childImageSharp":{"id":"01ff2f60-f251-5145-b073-50202173930c","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6125,"src":"/chareads.com/static/a5290d7cf3da77d9f8fc01278889cf13/e6555/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/a5290d7cf3da77d9f8fc01278889cf13/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/a5290d7cf3da77d9f8fc01278889cf13/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/a5290d7cf3da77d9f8fc01278889cf13/e6555/cover.jpg 245w","sizes":"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px"}}}},"html":"<p>youtu.be/MLtj0o7Pmzs</p>"},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"8fd65475-4d65-5f87-9688-2bdd9ae605b8","title":"Down And Out In Paris And London by George Orwell","datePublished":"2014-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2014-04-down-out-paris-london-george-orwell"},"timestamps":null,"image":{"id":"b8e97be2-8b77-58ea-93aa-5c4d9f27d285","childImageSharp":{"id":"5996f369-1770-5e12-af0a-99615506ea8d","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/77ebde80af3ff7ae28f5b31b3c436a79/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/77ebde80af3ff7ae28f5b31b3c436a79/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/77ebde80af3ff7ae28f5b31b3c436a79/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/77ebde80af3ff7ae28f5b31b3c436a79/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/77ebde80af3ff7ae28f5b31b3c436a79/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/77ebde80af3ff7ae28f5b31b3c436a79/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/77ebde80af3ff7ae28f5b31b3c436a79/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"fdcf9eb6-e08d-51ad-a4d7-b887147b0afd"}}}
