Here, he painstakingly documents a world of unrelenting drudgery and squalor - sleeping in bug-infested hostels and doss houses of last resort, working as a dishwasher in Paris's vile 'HÃ´tel X', surviving on scraps and cigarette butts, living alongside tramps, a star-gazing pavement artist and a starving Russian ex-army captain. Exposing a shocking, previously-hidden world to his readers, Orwell gave a human face to the statistics of poverty for the first time - and in doing so, found his voice as a brilliant writer.\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2014-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","2014-04-19T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":4,"pageCount":216,"dateRated":"2014-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2013-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2014-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","author":"George
