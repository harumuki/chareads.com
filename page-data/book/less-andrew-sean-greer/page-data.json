A wedding invitation arrives in the mail: your boyfriend of the past nine years is engaged to someone else. You can't say yes--it would be too awkward--and you can't say no--it would look like defeat. On your desk are a series of invitations to half-baked literary events around the world.\nQUESTION: How do you arrange to skip town?\nANSWER: You accept them all.\nWhat would possibly go wrong? Arthur Less will almost fall in love in Paris, almost fall to his death in Berlin, barely escape to a Moroccan ski chalet from a Saharan sandstorm, accidentally book himself as the (only) writer-in-residence at a Christian Retreat Center in Southern India, and encounter, on a desert island in the Arabian Sea, the last person on Earth he wants to face. Somewhere in there: he will turn fifty. Through it all, there is his first love. And there is his last.\nBecause, despite all these mishaps, missteps, misunderstandings and mistakes, LESS is, above all, a love story.\nA scintillating satire of the American abroad, a rumination on time and the human heart, a bittersweet romance of chances lost, by an author The New York Times has hailed as \"inspired, lyrical,\" \"elegiac,\" \"ingenious,\" as well as \"too sappy by half,\" LESS shows a writer at the peak of his talents raising the curtain on our shared human comedy.\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2019-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":3,"rating5":3,"pageCount":261,"dateRated":"2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":null,"dateReviewed":null,"author":"Andrew Sean Greer","image":{"id":"ca548f26-02e3-5e1d-9d20-f41acd9049e2","childImageSharp":{"id":"a9591fd8-a9e7-5998-853a-8b8de815face","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6441860465116279,"src":"/chareads.com/static/335655280960950f834a60ca273baf75/4e12f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/335655280960950f834a60ca273baf75/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/335655280960950f834a60ca273baf75/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/335655280960950f834a60ca273baf75/4e12f/cover.jpg 277w","sizes":"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"9affc604-d79f-5f8e-93f4-0492b28043a1","title":"April Reviews","datePublished":"2019-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-05-april-reviews"},"timestamps":[{"t":21,"book":{"id":"f75512ec-4d6b-5594-a636-ce6ab5bb28fd"}},{"t":170,"book":{"id":"97e4a714-7c38-5f36-a724-0c8c3b741754"}},{"t":386,"book":{"id":"3a77df57-ee9a-5157-8f7f-5a70cca7902d"}},{"t":742,"book":null},{"t":930,"book":null}],"image":{"id":"720f0657-ba02-5f2c-9d61-ed44bb3d125c","childImageSharp":{"id":"b8c66e1d-2c73-5e80-80e1-6bfb23868a7b","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/5ef945e0a0a913eaad043984bf7c16f6/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/5ef945e0a0a913eaad043984bf7c16f6/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/5ef945e0a0a913eaad043984bf7c16f6/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/5ef945e0a0a913eaad043984bf7c16f6/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/5ef945e0a0a913eaad043984bf7c16f6/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/5ef945e0a0a913eaad043984bf7c16f6/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/5ef945e0a0a913eaad043984bf7c16f6/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"f75512ec-4d6b-5594-a636-ce6ab5bb28fd"}}}
