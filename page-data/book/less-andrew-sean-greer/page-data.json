A wedding invitation arrives in the mail: your boyfriend of the past nine years is engaged to someone else. You can't say yes--it would be too awkward--and you can't say no--it would look like defeat. On your desk are a series of invitations to half-baked literary events around the world.\nQUESTION: How do you arrange to skip town?\nANSWER: You accept them all.\nWhat would possibly go wrong? Arthur Less will almost fall in love in Paris, almost fall to his death in Berlin, barely escape to a Moroccan ski chalet from a Saharan sandstorm, accidentally book himself as the (only) writer-in-residence at a Christian Retreat Center in Southern India, and encounter, on a desert island in the Arabian Sea, the last person on Earth he wants to face. Somewhere in there: he will turn fifty. Through it all, there is his first love. And there is his last.\nBecause, despite all these mishaps, missteps, misunderstandings and mistakes, LESS is, above all, a love story.\nA scintillating satire of the American abroad, a rumination on time and the human heart, a bittersweet romance of chances lost, by an author The New York Times has hailed as \"inspired, lyrical,\" \"elegiac,\" \"ingenious,\" as well as \"too sappy by half,\" LESS shows a writer at the peak of his talents raising the curtain on our shared human comedy.\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2019-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":3,"rating5":3,"pageCount":261,"dateRated":"2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":null,"dateReviewed":null,"author":"Andrew
