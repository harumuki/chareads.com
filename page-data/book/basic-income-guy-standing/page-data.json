This is an essential book.' Brian Eno Shouldn't everyone receive a stake in society's wealth? Could we create a fairer world by granting a guaranteed income to all? What would this mean for our health, wealth and happiness?\nBasic Income is a regular cash transfer from the state, received by all individual citizens. It is an acknowledgement that everyone plays a part in generating the wealth currently enjoyed only by a few. Political parties across the world are now adopting it as official policy and the idea generates headlines every day. Guy Standing has been at the forefront of thought about Basic Income for the past thirty years, and in this book he covers in authoritative detail its effects on the economy, poverty, work and labour; dissects and disproves the standard arguments against Basic Income; explains what we can learn from pilots across the world and illustrates exactly why a Basic Income has now become such an urgent necessity.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","sub-politics","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2017-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","2017-05-26T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":3,"pageCount":400,"dateRated":"2017-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2017-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2017-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Guy Standing","publisher":"Pelican","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"194969c4-ede3-5b02-b507-29aab761cb3e","childImageSharp":{"id":"45377e7d-cc0a-5b3f-9ace-ee6369215c32","h200":{"width":123,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/50d93f46444eceb58c62b38c89743c85/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/50d93f46444eceb58c62b38c89743c85/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/50d93f46444eceb58c62b38c89743c85/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/50d93f46444eceb58c62b38c89743c85/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":185,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/50d93f46444eceb58c62b38c89743c85/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/50d93f46444eceb58c62b38c89743c85/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":246,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/50d93f46444eceb58c62b38c89743c85/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/50d93f46444eceb58c62b38c89743c85/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#04CCCC","darkVibrant":"#04C4CA","lightVibrant":"#A0E8E4","muted":"#847C7C","darkMuted":"#345454","lightMuted":"#B4BCB8"}}},"html":"<p>Great book covering the critiques, alternatives, and practicalities of UBI.
