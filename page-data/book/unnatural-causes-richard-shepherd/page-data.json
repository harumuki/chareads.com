When death is sudden or unexplained, it falls to Shepherd to establish the cause. Each post-mortem is a detective story in its own right - and Shepherd has performed over 23,000 of them. Through his skill, dedication and insight, Dr Shepherd solves the puzzle to answer our most pressing question: how did this person die?\nFrom serial killer to natural disaster, 'perfect murder' to freak accident, Shepherd takes nothing for granted in pursuit of truth. And while he's been involved in some of the most high-profile cases of recent times, it's often the less well known encounters that prove the most perplexing, intriguing and even bizarre. In or out of the public eye, his evidence has put killers behind bars, freed the innocent and turned open-and-shut cases on their heads.\nBut a life in death, bearing witness to some of humanity's darkest corners, exacts a price and Shepherd doesn't flinch from counting the cost to him and his family.\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","form-audiobook","sub-science","sub-medical"],"readDates":[["2019-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","2019-05-23T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":3,"pageCount":400,"dateRated":"2019-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2018-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Richard Shepherd","image":{"id":"a835d05a-f1a4-51bd-bf67-31ef01877170","childImageSharp":{"id":"eda41c5a-2428-5c96-a476-9fb5f4559f2c","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.655,"src":"/chareads.com/static/464c2222982b51eb83c8cb602fc25042/7d99a/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/464c2222982b51eb83c8cb602fc25042/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/464c2222982b51eb83c8cb602fc25042/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/464c2222982b51eb83c8cb602fc25042/7d99a/cover.jpg 262w","sizes":"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#14A4AC","darkVibrant":"#078C92","lightVibrant":"#84CCD8","muted":"#67A5A8","darkMuted":"#437F7E","lightMuted":"#B1D3D5"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"84f8e0f4-9034-5085-8036-9af6bfa48956","title":"May Reviews","datePublished":"2019-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-05-may-reviews","viewCount":1320},"timestamps":[{"t":82,"book":{"id":"1f3269a7-76d1-5303-990d-8097f4e0a11c"}},{"t":350,"book":null},{"t":735,"book":{"id":"34d5496f-c346-56c0-9744-3a2faf30fcd1"}},{"t":1056,"book":{"id":"4ea67486-c4a0-5080-a101-6f2f55be7202"}}],"image":{"id":"ffd5a49b-0dae-5b76-a6a1-840dd50fd036","childImageSharp":{"id":"5115154e-a514-5976-97bf-643329331441","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#A9923C","darkVibrant":"#94942E","lightVibrant":"#C5E1F9","muted":"#8E6771","darkMuted":"#4C3033","lightMuted":"#C29FA5"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34d5496f-c346-56c0-9744-3a2faf30fcd1"}}}
