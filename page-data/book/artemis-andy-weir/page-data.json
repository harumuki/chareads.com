Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itselfâ€”and that now, her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first.\n","tags":["genre-science-fiction","form-audiobook","type-fiction","sub-space"],"readDates":[["2018-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","2018-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":4,"pageCount":305,"dateRated":"2018-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2017-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Andy Weir","image":{"id":"68756585-85b5-5f6b-a86c-00331c0938bb","childImageSharp":{"id":"f297a445-0e7f-51da-bd3d-35aa1bda8913","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6534883720930232,"src":"/chareads.com/static/8f3d1072dbcf68f69cc9b2031e9cd51c/e534e/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/8f3d1072dbcf68f69cc9b2031e9cd51c/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/8f3d1072dbcf68f69cc9b2031e9cd51c/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/8f3d1072dbcf68f69cc9b2031e9cd51c/e534e/cover.jpg 281w","sizes":"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2904222a-3988-56da-b357-52fe7b8603d2"}}}
