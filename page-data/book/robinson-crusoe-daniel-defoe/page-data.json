Here is the novel which has inspired countless imitations by lesser writers, none of which equal the power and originality of Defoe's famous book. Robinson Crusoe, set ashore on an island after a terrible storm at sea, is forced to make do with only a knife, some tobacco, and a pipe. He learns how to build a canoe, make bread, and endure endless solitude. That is, until, twenty-four years later, when he confronts another human being. First published in 1719, Robinson Crusoe has been praised by such writers as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Samuel Johnson as one of the greatest novels in the English language.\n","tags":["genre-pre-war-classic","type-fiction","form-paperback","pub-english-library"],"readDates":[["2017-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","2017-06-22T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":3,"pageCount":337,"dateRated":"2017-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2012-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Daniel Defoe","image":{"id":"c1b7b29f-21c8-5b8a-af8f-f6b32a7adec5","childImageSharp":{"id":"5cef1a9a-c06d-568f-aaf4-2cf2a5553c71","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/3824801b1f07ba1c65f7756a291f9100/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/3824801b1f07ba1c65f7756a291f9100/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/3824801b1f07ba1c65f7756a291f9100/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/3824801b1f07ba1c65f7756a291f9100/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"bd721c8a-476e-5c26-bad4-58e0df45885b","title":"Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe","datePublished":"2017-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2017-07-robinson-crusoe-daniel-defoe"},"timestamps":[{"t":30,"book":null},{"t":65,"book":null},{"t":120,"book":null},{"t":135,"book":null},{"t":220,"book":null},{"t":272,"book":null},{"t":350,"book":null},{"t":423,"book":null},{"t":535,"book":null},{"t":630,"book":null}],"image":{"id":"fbf17eeb-0df7-57bd-8b85-dcbe1f7ece06","childImageSharp":{"id":"23ee304a-1017-590b-9215-521491f98608","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/5d8dc9eb536e0be309b987fc3b3e87cb/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/5d8dc9eb536e0be309b987fc3b3e87cb/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/5d8dc9eb536e0be309b987fc3b3e87cb/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/5d8dc9eb536e0be309b987fc3b3e87cb/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/5d8dc9eb536e0be309b987fc3b3e87cb/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/5d8dc9eb536e0be309b987fc3b3e87cb/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/5d8dc9eb536e0be309b987fc3b3e87cb/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4a9d0ae4-f0af-52bb-9c95-f618f0fe9f10"}}}
