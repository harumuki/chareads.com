Kathy is getting married. It’s the summer of 2017 and the whole world is falling apart. Fast-paced and frantic, Crudo unfolds in real time from the full-throttle perspective of a commitment-phobic artist who may or may not be Kathy Acker.\nFrom a Tuscan hotel for the superrich to a Brexit-paralyzed United Kingdom, Kathy spends the first summer of her forties adjusting to the idea of a lifelong commitment. But it’s not only Kathy who’s changing. Fascism is on the rise, truth is dead, the planet is heating up, and Trump is tweeting the world ever-closer to nuclear war. How do you make art, let alone a life, when one rogue tweet could end it all?\nIn Crudo, her first work of fiction, Olivia Laing radically rewires the novel with a fierce, compassionate account of learning to love when the end of the world seems near.\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","gifted","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2020-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","2020-02-06T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":2,"pageCount":176,"dateRated":"2020-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2019-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2020-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Olivia Laing","image":{"id":"dd3d8922-d8d3-5a11-b30c-4f4052e6df73","childImageSharp":{"id":"fc0bf799-1ffe-59b8-a0d8-2c2a11be7955","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.65,"src":"/chareads.com/static/6c8f9eaf8e49c873558eb2a0dc73515b/90e08/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/6c8f9eaf8e49c873558eb2a0dc73515b/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/6c8f9eaf8e49c873558eb2a0dc73515b/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/6c8f9eaf8e49c873558eb2a0dc73515b/90e08/cover.jpg 260w","sizes":"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#1DAFBA","darkVibrant":"#34A4A4","lightVibrant":"#8CD4E4","muted":"#A97361","darkMuted":"#7A4947","lightMuted":"#A0C5C8"}}},"html":"<p>Crudo is written <em>by</em> and about Kathy, a 40 year old woman getting married in the summer of 2017. Kathy’s life isn’t particularly extraordinary or interesting, but the style of writing gave her a dramatic, erratic aura that grated on me (as it was meant to?).\nI felt pretty called out by the snippet “she liked hysterics but also stoics”, but other than that felt little to no attachment to the character. However, I did think about myself a lot while reading this, how I think differently to her and would make different decisions, and finished the book with a profound awareness of my own autonomy - a terrific feeling, hard to come by when reading in someone else’s world.</p>"},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"76cfc608-1e73-58be-ae39-c60775d396a3"}}}
