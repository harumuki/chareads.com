Kathy is getting married. It’s the summer of 2017 and the whole world is falling apart. Fast-paced and frantic, Crudo unfolds in real time from the full-throttle perspective of a commitment-phobic artist who may or may not be Kathy Acker.\nFrom a Tuscan hotel for the superrich to a Brexit-paralyzed United Kingdom, Kathy spends the first summer of her forties adjusting to the idea of a lifelong commitment. But it’s not only Kathy who’s changing. Fascism is on the rise, truth is dead, the planet is heating up, and Trump is tweeting the world ever-closer to nuclear war. How do you make art, let alone a life, when one rogue tweet could end it all?\nIn Crudo, her first work of fiction, Olivia Laing radically rewires the novel with a fierce, compassionate account of learning to love when the end of the world seems near.\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","gifted","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2020-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","2020-02-06T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":2,"pageCount":176,"dateRated":"2020-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2019-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2020-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Olivia Laing","image":{"id":"dd3d8922-d8d3-5a11-b30c-4f4052e6df73","childImageSharp":{"id":"fc0bf799-1ffe-59b8-a0d8-2c2a11be7955","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.65,"src":"/chareads.com/static/6c8f9eaf8e49c873558eb2a0dc73515b/90e08/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/6c8f9eaf8e49c873558eb2a0dc73515b/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/6c8f9eaf8e49c873558eb2a0dc73515b/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/6c8f9eaf8e49c873558eb2a0dc73515b/90e08/cover.jpg 260w","sizes":"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#1DAFBA","darkVibrant":"#34A4A4","lightVibrant":"#8CD4E4","muted":"#A97361","darkMuted":"#7A4947","lightMuted":"#A0C5C8"}}},"html":"<p>Crudo is written <em>by</em> and about Kathy, a 40 year old woman getting married in the summer of 2017.
