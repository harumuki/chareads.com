His job is to burn books, which are forbidden, being the source of all discord and unhappiness. Even so, Montag is unhappy; there is discord in his marriage. Are books hidden in his house? The Mechanical Hound of the Fire Department, armed with a lethal hypodermic, escorted by helicopters, is ready to track down those dissidents who defy society to preserve and read books.\nThe classic dystopian novel of a post-literate future, Fahrenheit 451 stands alongside Orwell’s 1984 and Huxley’s Brave New World as a prophetic account of Western civilization’s enslavement by the media, drugs and conformity.\nBradbury’s powerful and poetic prose combines with uncanny insight into the potential of technology to create a novel which, decades on from first publication, still has the power to dazzle and shock.\n--back cover\n","tags":["genre-science-fiction","sub-dystopia","type-fiction","form-hardback"],"readDates":[["2014-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","2014-01-23T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":5,"pageCount":227,"dateRated":"2014-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2013-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Ray Bradbury","image":{"id":"d5a71e57-4daf-50e9-af23-78ed68aa1bd8","childImageSharp":{"id":"88c6a511-d0b6-5318-8efe-d8da31c3e445","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.7,"src":"/chareads.com/static/e8478cb1a1f7d1f164bbc68b34603109/f5783/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/e8478cb1a1f7d1f164bbc68b34603109/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/e8478cb1a1f7d1f164bbc68b34603109/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/e8478cb1a1f7d1f164bbc68b34603109/f5783/cover.jpg 280w","sizes":"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0a635d0c-5a19-5313-8d96-070720c37548"}}}
