Salome is a simple tale of complex passion. Wilde's heroine bears no resemblance to her biblical origin. His Salome is no mere instrument of Herodias, but a dangerous and passionate young woman whose thwarted affections for John the Baptist lead to a disasterous climax for all persons involved. Wilde's script is a brilliant look at deep-rooted desires and the dangers of obsession. This edition of the play is a must for anyone building their own theatrical library.\n","tags":["sub-theology","form-paperback","type-play"],"readDates":[["2019-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","2019-05-19T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":null,"pageCount":36,"dateRated":null,"dateBookPublished":"2002-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Oscar Wilde","image":{"id":"f4e3fbf1-247f-5d4f-90df-335010852945","childImageSharp":{"id":"55d18a3b-1732-50ae-8bcb-f11b8e13a915","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6175,"src":"/chareads.com/static/9a79c2d134583c4acf378c51801da0f5/4ed89/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/9a79c2d134583c4acf378c51801da0f5/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/9a79c2d134583c4acf378c51801da0f5/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/9a79c2d134583c4acf378c51801da0f5/4ed89/cover.jpg 247w","sizes":"(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"a078bbad-9efc-5191-8980-faf1b11ceaf4"}}}
