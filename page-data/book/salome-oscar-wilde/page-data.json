Salome is a simple tale of complex passion. Wilde's heroine bears no resemblance to her biblical origin. His Salome is no mere instrument of Herodias, but a dangerous and passionate young woman whose thwarted affections for John the Baptist lead to a disasterous climax for all persons involved. Wilde's script is a brilliant look at deep-rooted desires and the dangers of obsession. This edition of the play is a must for anyone building their own theatrical library.\n","tags":["sub-theology","form-paperback","type-play"],"readDates":[["2019-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","2019-05-19T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":null,"pageCount":36,"dateRated":null,"dateBookPublished":"2002-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Oscar
