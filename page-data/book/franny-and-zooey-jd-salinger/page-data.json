They appear to be the perfect couple, but as they struggle to communicate with each other about the things they really care about, slowly their true feelings come to the surface. The second story in this book, 'Zooey', plunges us into the world of her ethereal, sophisticated family. When Franny's emotional and spiritual doubts reach new heights, her older brother Zooey, a misanthropic former child genius, offers her consolation and brotherly advice. \nWritten in Salinger's typically irreverent style, these two stories offer a touching snapshot of the distraught mindset of early adulthood and are full of the insightful emotional observations and witty turns of phrase that have helped make Salinger's reputation what it is today\n","tags":["sub-ennui","favourite","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2012-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","2012-09-01T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":4,"pageCount":150,"dateRated":"2012-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2010-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"J.D.
