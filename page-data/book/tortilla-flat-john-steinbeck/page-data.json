Danny is a paisano, descended from the original Spanish settlers who arrived in Monterey, California, centuries before. He values friendship above money and possessions, so when he suddenly inherits two houses, Danny is quick to offer shelter to his fellow gentlemen of the road. Together, their love of freedom and scorn for material things draws them into daring and often hilarious adventures. That is, until Danny, tiring of his new responsibilities, suddenly disappears…John Steinbeck (1902-68), winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for literature, is remembered as one of the greatest and best-loved American writers of the twentieth century. During the Second World War Steinbeck served as a war correspondent, with his collected dispatches published as \"Once There Was a War\" (1958); in 1945 he was awarded the Norwegian Cross of Freedom for his novel \"The Moon is Down\" (1942), a portrayal of Resistance efforts in northern Europe. His best-known works include the epics \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1939) and \"East of Eden\" (1952), and his tragic novella \"Of Mice and Men\" (1937). John Steinbeck's complete works are published in \"Penguin Modern Classics\". If you enjoyed \"Tortilla Flat\", you might like Steinbeck's \"Cannery Row\", also available in \"Penguin Modern Classics\". \"Steinbeck…tells the stories of these lovable thieves and adulterers with a poetic purity of heart and prose\".
