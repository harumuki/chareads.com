His baffling tricks and stunning illusions have set new standards of what's possible, as well as causing controversy. Now, for the first time, he reveals the secrets behind his craft.\nHe delves into the structure and pyschology of magic. He tells you how to read clues in people's behaviour and spot liars. He discusses the whys and wherefores of hypnosis (which he says doesn't exist) and shows how to use the powers of suggestion and massively improve the power of your memory. He also investigates the paranormal industry, exposes a few charlatans and looks at why some of us feel the need to believe in it in the first place… Woven into this are autobiographical stories about Derren's own experiences and beliefs, told with characteristic humour and engaging honesty. This extraordinary book lifts the lid on the deepest darkest secrets of magic and explores the limits of what can be achieved by the human mind. A must for Derren's legions of fans, it will amaze you, entertain you and expand your mind at the same time…\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2014-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","2014-01-22T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":null,"pageCount":400,"dateRated":null,"dateBookPublished":"2007-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Derren
