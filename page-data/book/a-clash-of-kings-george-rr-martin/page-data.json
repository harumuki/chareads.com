From the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding lands of Winterfell, chaos reigns as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms stake their claims through tempest, turmoil and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky - a comet the colour of blood and flame - five factions struggle for control of a divided land. Brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the night.\n","tags":["genre-fantasy","form-audiobook","type-fiction"],"readDates":[["2014-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","2014-03-31T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":4,"pageCount":913,"dateRated":"2014-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2011-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"George R.R.
