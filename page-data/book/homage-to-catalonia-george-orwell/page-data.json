Thus wrote Orwell following his experiences as a militiaman in the Spanish Civil War, chronicled in Homage to Catalonia. Here he brings to bear all the force of his humanity, passion and clarity, describing with bitter intensity the bright hopes and cynical betrayals of that chaotic episode: the revolutionary euphoria of Barcelona, the courage of ordinary Spanish men and women he fought alongside, the terror and confusion of the front, his near-fatal bullet wound and the vicious treachery of his supposed allies.\nEric Arthur Blair (1903-1950), better known by his pen-name, George Orwell, was born in India, where his father worked for the Civil Service. An author and journalist, Orwell was one of the most prominent and influential figures in twentieth-century literature. His unique political allegory Animal Farm was published in 1945, and it was this novel, together with the dystopia of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), which brought him world-wide fame. All his novels and non-fiction, including Burmese Days (1934), Down and Out in Paris and London (1933), The Road to Wigan Pier (1937) and Homage to Catalonia (1938) are published in Penguin Modern Classics.\n","tags":["type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2018-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","2018-03-01T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":3,"rating5":3,"pageCount":256,"dateRated":"2018-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2013-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"George Orwell","image":{"id":"5757d7ca-a100-589d-9486-caa2d1a5b7f0","childImageSharp":{"id":"0cd9753d-e267-5455-b8c2-8774d7503505","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6125,"src":"/chareads.com/static/d75480b1ac8fec13808682dc2a8f46f3/e6555/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/d75480b1ac8fec13808682dc2a8f46f3/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/d75480b1ac8fec13808682dc2a8f46f3/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/d75480b1ac8fec13808682dc2a8f46f3/e6555/cover.jpg 245w","sizes":"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"a06350f8-36e5-5e6e-ba9e-c0ed4f72229e","title":"6 Months Of Reviews","datePublished":"2018-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2018-05-6-months-of-reviews"},"timestamps":[{"t":50,"book":null},{"t":75,"book":null},{"t":80,"book":{"id":"7fddc040-376e-5faa-a06e-cae6d488974e"}},{"t":172,"book":{"id":"5dc452f8-2ed9-5e88-be8f-03cd2eb88c28"}},{"t":232,"book":{"id":"7423e908-1902-5bcd-823f-2947787e4196"}},{"t":240,"book":{"id":"cc60b8b3-06a1-5158-aad0-79d30589a400"}},{"t":366,"book":{"id":"0da17b03-5412-5e4a-a74b-523575a483c3"}},{"t":420,"book":null},{"t":535,"book":{"id":"79e7361b-e931-5d0a-9377-f0cfa120f0ed"}},{"t":589,"book":{"id":"1074264c-aad1-5468-a521-683f57e3568f"}},{"t":788,"book":{"id":"7a1339bc-ac7b-5afa-bd21-b6a4b1f9ba6a"}},{"t":840,"book":{"id":"7f849578-aea8-5a64-be13-5a09997d75ed"}},{"t":963,"book":{"id":"e3a7e17c-bd98-5c66-b3b7-9d5a9e1e15f4"}},{"t":1060,"book":{"id":"82a061f0-5682-50cc-b3c3-a33e35d689de"}},{"t":1077,"book":{"id":"9ea21ed0-0b48-5555-b8b1-b59a8801a022"}},{"t":1105,"book":{"id":"8d99ae54-6ca6-59bf-91ce-66fa0dbac3ac"}},{"t":1184,"book":{"id":"1b199a52-8d32-56f8-8a3f-806f5d31b4e9"}},{"t":1184,"book":{"id":"1b199a52-8d32-56f8-8a3f-806f5d31b4e9"}},{"t":1326,"book":{"id":"bbde3728-5c2a-5069-ae3a-2673a2b441b5"}},{"t":1447,"book":null},{"t":1600,"book":null},{"t":1760,"book":{"id":"3f364562-0a93-5616-b436-88193dafaf00"}},{"t":1900,"book":{"id":"e520c7a9-acf7-599c-bd51-2b9b08e47d4c"}},{"t":1990,"book":{"id":"7d3db2cc-1af6-5dff-af29-18a602892fb8"}},{"t":2151,"book":{"id":"4b9b5aff-fd7f-50fc-9a07-123eae9d5904"}},{"t":2160,"book":{"id":"d20f4a5f-2661-50b2-87d2-cdf55cf41e6a"}},{"t":2356,"book":{"id":"2e4f49a8-56bc-5bcf-9fcb-8ad84bf92fe3"}}],"image":{"id":"769cc0c5-de66-5ff5-960f-800955241db1","childImageSharp":{"id":"7dbe94aa-6c5c-5005-ab05-a4fbd5cdb8f4","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"79e7361b-e931-5d0a-9377-f0cfa120f0ed"}}}
