There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity. Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.\n","tags":["sub-ennui","favourite","genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","2018-05-21T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":7,"rating5":5,"pageCount":720,"dateRated":"2018-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2015-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2018-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Hanya Yanagihara","image":{"id":"e28b210f-89b7-5f38-91b1-0971b94285f3","childImageSharp":{"id":"e335bf5b-3ac4-52a1-b3c6-1559c6e73083","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.555256064690027,"src":"/chareads.com/static/e9c40b6f4f4bf3498a39016f1f650d09/5a4fc/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/e9c40b6f4f4bf3498a39016f1f650d09/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/e9c40b6f4f4bf3498a39016f1f650d09/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/e9c40b6f4f4bf3498a39016f1f650d09/5a4fc/cover.jpg 206w","sizes":"(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#9C2C3C","darkVibrant":"#832C38","lightVibrant":"#FCECF0","muted":"#9D8185","darkMuted":"#4E3C39","lightMuted":"#C1A9AE"}}},"html":"<p>My life was on pause while I read this book.
