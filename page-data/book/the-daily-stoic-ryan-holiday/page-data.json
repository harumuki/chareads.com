Modern readers praise Stoic philosophy for its unique blend of practicality and wisdom. But it's admittedly hard for the average reader to decipher the Dover Thrift edition of Marcus Aurelius' work. The antiquated, needlessly formal language of most modern translations is stripped down in this book, revealing powerful aphorisms that cut straight to the heart of our day-to-day challenges. Presented in a page-per-day format, this daily resource of Stoic inspiration combines new translations of Seneca, Epictetus, Zeno by Stephen Hanselman with calls to further reflection--and action--by Ryan Holiday. Arranged topically following the same three movements (Perception, Action, Will) that Holiday used inThe Obstacle is the Way, this guide features twelve principles for overcoming obstacles and achieving greater satisfaction. Aimed at the high-octane, action-oriented, doers of our wired world, this book is intended to open to them a new daily ritual and a new orientation that will bring balanced action, insight, effectiveness, and serenity.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","sub-business-productivity","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2019-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":null,"pageCount":416,"dateRated":null,"dateBookPublished":"2016-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Ryan Holiday","image":{"id":"96486340-1333-587a-a9eb-4cbdc2db6c14","childImageSharp":{"id":"20cacf87-5d57-5103-9fa9-27448a3eae4f","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6575,"src":"/chareads.com/static/1bd10d23fc03089cb9d6d70fd1d83eff/53727/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/1bd10d23fc03089cb9d6d70fd1d83eff/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/1bd10d23fc03089cb9d6d70fd1d83eff/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/1bd10d23fc03089cb9d6d70fd1d83eff/53727/cover.jpg 263w","sizes":"(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#AC8404","darkVibrant":"#AC8D0E","lightVibrant":"#DCCE96","muted":"#8E8C83","darkMuted":"#686660","lightMuted":"#D1CB95"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"07ff5e2d-8e13-5abe-9865-654e052fdbcc"}}}
