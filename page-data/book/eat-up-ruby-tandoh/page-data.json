A moment ago, you could have been thinking about anything, but now it's thickly buttered marmite toast, a frosty scoop of ice cream straight from the tub, some creamy, cheesy scrambled eggs or a fuzzy, perfectly-ripe peach.\nEating is one of life's greatest pleasures. Food nourishes our bodies, helps us celebrate our successes (from a wedding cake to a post-night out kebab), cheers us up when we're down, introduces us to new cultures and -- when we cook and eat together -- connects us with the people we love.\nIn Eat Up, Ruby Tandoh celebrates the fun and pleasure of food, taking a look at everything from gluttons and gourmets in the movies, to the symbolism of food and sex. She will arm you against the fad diets, food crazes and bad science that can make eating guilt-laden and expensive, drawing eating inspiration from influences as diverse as Roald Dahl, Nora Ephron and Gemma from TOWIE. Filled with straight-talking, sympathetic advice on everything from mental health to recipe ideas and shopping tips, this is a book that clears away the fog, to help you fall back in love with food.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","sub-food","sub-psychology","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2018-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","2018-03-09T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":4,"pageCount":248,"dateRated":"2018-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2018-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Ruby Tandoh","image":{"id":"9d8e375f-8b1b-537d-8f3d-20fbca5135d4","childImageSharp":{"id":"5753896f-6ea4-5e85-8ff4-cd5868e77227","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6475,"src":"/chareads.com/static/fcc2e3c8bf537ee6d0ad04967473969f/0efb0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/fcc2e3c8bf537ee6d0ad04967473969f/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/fcc2e3c8bf537ee6d0ad04967473969f/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/fcc2e3c8bf537ee6d0ad04967473969f/0efb0/cover.jpg 259w","sizes":"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"a06350f8-36e5-5e6e-ba9e-c0ed4f72229e","title":"6 Months Of Reviews","datePublished":"2018-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2018-05-6-months-of-reviews"},"timestamps":[{"t":50,"book":null},{"t":75,"book":null},{"t":80,"book":{"id":"7fddc040-376e-5faa-a06e-cae6d488974e"}},{"t":172,"book":{"id":"5dc452f8-2ed9-5e88-be8f-03cd2eb88c28"}},{"t":232,"book":{"id":"7423e908-1902-5bcd-823f-2947787e4196"}},{"t":240,"book":{"id":"cc60b8b3-06a1-5158-aad0-79d30589a400"}},{"t":366,"book":{"id":"0da17b03-5412-5e4a-a74b-523575a483c3"}},{"t":420,"book":null},{"t":535,"book":{"id":"79e7361b-e931-5d0a-9377-f0cfa120f0ed"}},{"t":589,"book":{"id":"1074264c-aad1-5468-a521-683f57e3568f"}},{"t":788,"book":{"id":"7a1339bc-ac7b-5afa-bd21-b6a4b1f9ba6a"}},{"t":840,"book":{"id":"7f849578-aea8-5a64-be13-5a09997d75ed"}},{"t":963,"book":{"id":"e3a7e17c-bd98-5c66-b3b7-9d5a9e1e15f4"}},{"t":1060,"book":{"id":"82a061f0-5682-50cc-b3c3-a33e35d689de"}},{"t":1077,"book":{"id":"9ea21ed0-0b48-5555-b8b1-b59a8801a022"}},{"t":1105,"book":{"id":"8d99ae54-6ca6-59bf-91ce-66fa0dbac3ac"}},{"t":1184,"book":{"id":"1b199a52-8d32-56f8-8a3f-806f5d31b4e9"}},{"t":1184,"book":{"id":"1b199a52-8d32-56f8-8a3f-806f5d31b4e9"}},{"t":1326,"book":{"id":"bbde3728-5c2a-5069-ae3a-2673a2b441b5"}},{"t":1447,"book":null},{"t":1600,"book":null},{"t":1760,"book":{"id":"3f364562-0a93-5616-b436-88193dafaf00"}},{"t":1900,"book":{"id":"e520c7a9-acf7-599c-bd51-2b9b08e47d4c"}},{"t":1990,"book":{"id":"7d3db2cc-1af6-5dff-af29-18a602892fb8"}},{"t":2151,"book":{"id":"4b9b5aff-fd7f-50fc-9a07-123eae9d5904"}},{"t":2160,"book":{"id":"d20f4a5f-2661-50b2-87d2-cdf55cf41e6a"}},{"t":2356,"book":{"id":"2e4f49a8-56bc-5bcf-9fcb-8ad84bf92fe3"}}],"image":{"id":"769cc0c5-de66-5ff5-960f-800955241db1","childImageSharp":{"id":"7dbe94aa-6c5c-5005-ab05-a4fbd5cdb8f4","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1074264c-aad1-5468-a521-683f57e3568f"}}}
