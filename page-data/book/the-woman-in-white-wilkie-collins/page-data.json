Engaged as a drawing master to the beautiful Laura Fairlie, Walter is drawn into the sinister intrigues of Sir Percival Glyde and his 'charming' friend Count Fosco, who has a taste for white mice, vanilla bonbons and poison. Pursuing questions of identity and insanity along the paths and corridors of English country houses and the madhouse, The Woman in White is the first and most influential of the Victorian genre that combined Gothic horror with psychological realism.\n","tags":["genre-pre-war-classic","genre-crime-mystery","type-fiction","form-paperback","pub-english-library"],"readDates":[["2017-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","2017-09-13T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":3,"rating5":3,"pageCount":702,"dateRated":"2017-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2012-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Wilkie Collins","image":{"id":"23673838-1e7a-590d-a84f-630ff4d8bac5","childImageSharp":{"id":"b374619c-c6ec-572c-a7b5-4bda34d8e2bc","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/7af88d314cf5cd7b4169a25141e7643f/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/7af88d314cf5cd7b4169a25141e7643f/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/7af88d314cf5cd7b4169a25141e7643f/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/7af88d314cf5cd7b4169a25141e7643f/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#7F52AD","darkVibrant":"#442C5C","lightVibrant":"#BDA5D4","muted":"#78728B","darkMuted":"#3C2C5A","lightMuted":"#BABCC6"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"307318ca-ffdd-5028-a49b-5fd7bbe7d027","title":"Why I don't like Victorian Literature | The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins","datePublished":"2017-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2017-09-why-i-dont-like-victorian-literature","viewCount":3367},"timestamps":null,"image":{"id":"7be9028a-8798-5b59-bd8a-c329f5c91e66","childImageSharp":{"id":"7b5de393-91de-54c9-a160-d09f860c8e48","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/a71efbcfce2cbe8eb9b332cc66628ded/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/a71efbcfce2cbe8eb9b332cc66628ded/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/a71efbcfce2cbe8eb9b332cc66628ded/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/a71efbcfce2cbe8eb9b332cc66628ded/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/a71efbcfce2cbe8eb9b332cc66628ded/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/a71efbcfce2cbe8eb9b332cc66628ded/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/a71efbcfce2cbe8eb9b332cc66628ded/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D23F7E","darkVibrant":"#04152F","lightVibrant":"#B0C9E4","muted":"#676898","darkMuted":"#303B59","lightMuted":"#CAB0B3"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"b602ee77-41af-5b91-8a30-cdfe34776213"}}}
