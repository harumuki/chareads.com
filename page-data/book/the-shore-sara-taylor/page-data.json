A collection of small islands sticking out from the coast of Virginia into the Atlantic Ocean that has been home to generations of fierce and resilient women. Sanctuary to some but nightmare to others, it’s a place they’ve inhabited, fled, and returned to for hundreds of years. From a brave girl’s determination to protect her younger sister as methamphetamine ravages their family, to a lesson in summoning storm clouds to help end a drought, these women struggle against domestic violence, savage wilderness, and the corrosive effects of poverty and addiction to secure a sense of well-being for themselves and for those they love.\nTheir interconnecting stories form a deeply affecting legacy of two island families, illuminating the small miracles and miseries of a community of outsiders, and the bonds of blood and fate that connect them all.\nDreamlike and yet impossibly real, profound and playful, The Shore is a richly unique, breathtakingly ambitious and accomplished debut novel by a young writer of astonishing gifts.\n","tags":["type-short-stories","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2015-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","2015-05-28T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":4,"pageCount":304,"dateRated":"2015-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2015-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2015-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Sara Taylor","publisher":"William Heinemann","bookHeight":236,"image":{"id":"3c3c7cd3-ad26-5926-8d27-c46b94b24ed5","childImageSharp":{"id":"5e6c5d8f-7058-5ade-a386-c977d26b43bb","h200":{"width":121,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/52ed0befbcb7841ab04cc64a18714bda/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/52ed0befbcb7841ab04cc64a18714bda/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/52ed0befbcb7841ab04cc64a18714bda/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/52ed0befbcb7841ab04cc64a18714bda/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":181,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/52ed0befbcb7841ab04cc64a18714bda/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/52ed0befbcb7841ab04cc64a18714bda/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":241,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/52ed0befbcb7841ab04cc64a18714bda/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/52ed0befbcb7841ab04cc64a18714bda/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D34235","darkVibrant":"#A2292B","lightVibrant":"#E7BB90","muted":"#9E735F","darkMuted":"#53352E","lightMuted":"#CDB7A8"}}},"html":"<p>It took some time but I really enjoyed this book.
