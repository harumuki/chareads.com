He leaves for boarding school to seek what the dying poet Francois Rabelais called the \"Great Perhaps.\" Much awaits Miles at Culver Creek, including Alaska Young. Clever, funny, screwed-up, and dead sexy, Alaska will pull Miles into her labyrinth and catapult him into the Great Perhaps.\nLooking for Alaska brilliantly chronicles the indelible impact one life can have on another. A stunning debut, it marks John Green's arrival as an important new voice in contemporary fiction.\n","tags":["genre-young-adult","genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2013-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":268,"dateRated":"2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2006-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"John Green","publisher":"HarperCollins Children's Books","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"622f3203-5f25-5a65-bff7-0c337df273f0","childImageSharp":{"id":"563999a3-26b3-5dfa-bddf-132699207dd5","h200":{"width":131,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":196,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":261,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D4CC34","darkVibrant":"#4C4014","lightVibrant":"#E8E492","muted":"#8C8454","darkMuted":"#534C31","lightMuted":"#C4C4C4"}}},"html":"","relatedBooks":[{"id":"b17caef8-966e-54f9-a534-55740862a077","fields":{"slug":"/book/paper-towns-john-green"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Paper Towns","author":"John Green","rating7":6,"dateReviewed":"2014-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"3cfed24a-86eb-5afa-9a33-1a5c843f39a3","childImageSharp":{"id":"ca347c9e-164f-51d7-9cb8-ed1139e95e32","h150":{"width":100,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/9e8fa39ffdcdb7edd00682659e867325/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/9e8fa39ffdcdb7edd00682659e867325/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/9e8fa39ffdcdb7edd00682659e867325/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/9e8fa39ffdcdb7edd00682659e867325/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":234,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/9e8fa39ffdcdb7edd00682659e867325/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/9e8fa39ffdcdb7edd00682659e867325/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#C2162C","darkVibrant":"#990F20","lightVibrant":"#D5DBA5","muted":"#AC5E52","darkMuted":"#37302A","lightMuted":"#C8B5A3"}}},"video":{"id":"4f84f67e-3b4f-5dec-be7b-eb71100980ac","fields":{"slug":"/video/2014-12-paper-towns-john-green"}}},{"id":"18e8f229-5d39-5d15-8694-4ea274b10f00","fields":{"slug":"/book/the-fault-in-our-stars-john-green"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Fault in Our Stars","author":"John Green","rating7":null,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"881e6084-6d32-56b7-9fbc-e2629b4049da","childImageSharp":{"id":"d7bc113c-5801-5d18-aa27-9f032c0a3cba","h150":{"width":98,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/d57b033e361f6eb0ecef11dfb93a1a3a/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/d57b033e361f6eb0ecef11dfb93a1a3a/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/d57b033e361f6eb0ecef11dfb93a1a3a/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/d57b033e361f6eb0ecef11dfb93a1a3a/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":228,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/d57b033e361f6eb0ecef11dfb93a1a3a/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/d57b033e361f6eb0ecef11dfb93a1a3a/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#EEE218","darkVibrant":"#1C446C","lightVibrant":"#84D4DC","muted":"#7C807E","darkMuted":"#273A46","lightMuted":"#BCBCBC"}}},"video":null},{"id":"25bf5808-9e24-53ff-8d73-028245b5b2a1","fields":{"slug":"/book/turtles-all-the-way-down-john-green"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Turtles All the Way Down","author":"John Green","rating7":5,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":236,"image":{"id":"04739f5a-94c3-5657-a790-0d2ddcfe441e","childImageSharp":{"id":"f5dc96e8-f167-57c0-93f4-bc8a194a3fca","h150":{"width":98,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":229,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#FC6C04","darkVibrant":"#853C14","lightVibrant":"#EEC691","muted":"#90826C","darkMuted":"#474636","lightMuted":"#DCD0B4"}}},"video":null},{"id":"f23eec06-f795-5aa2-b263-6aebe6843e4d","fields":{"slug":"/book/we-were-liars-e-lockhart"},"frontmatter":{"title":"We Were Liars","author":"E.
