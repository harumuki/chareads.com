He leaves for boarding school to seek what the dying poet Francois Rabelais called the \"Great Perhaps.\" Much awaits Miles at Culver Creek, including Alaska Young. Clever, funny, screwed-up, and dead sexy, Alaska will pull Miles into her labyrinth and catapult him into the Great Perhaps.\nLooking for Alaska brilliantly chronicles the indelible impact one life can have on another. A stunning debut, it marks John Green's arrival as an important new voice in contemporary fiction.\n","tags":["genre-young-adult","genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2013-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":268,"dateRated":"2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2006-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"John Green","image":{"id":"622f3203-5f25-5a65-bff7-0c337df273f0","childImageSharp":{"id":"563999a3-26b3-5dfa-bddf-132699207dd5","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/908ff8f078bce85ed8baafc00e6ddf09/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D4CC34","darkVibrant":"#4C4014","lightVibrant":"#E8E492","muted":"#8C8454","darkMuted":"#534C31","lightMuted":"#C4C4C4"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2bbae86b-184f-502d-9ba5-ce43d0e7e329"}}}
