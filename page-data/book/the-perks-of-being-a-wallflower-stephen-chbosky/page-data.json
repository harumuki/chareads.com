I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that dayâ€¦or wondering who did the heart breaking and wondering why.\"\nCharlie is a freshman. And while he's not the biggest geek in the school, he is by no means popular. Shy, introspective, intelligent beyond his years yet socially awkward, he is a wallflower, caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it. Charlie is attempting to navigate his way through uncharted territory: the world of first dates and mixed tapes, family dramas and new friends; the world of sex, drugs, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, when all one requires is that perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite. But Charlie can't stay on the sideline forever. Standing on the fringes of life offers a unique perspective. But there comes a time to see what it looks like from the dance floor.\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower is a deeply affecting coming-of-age story that will spirit you back to those wild and poignant roller-coaster days known as growing up.\n","tags":["genre-young-adult","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2010-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","2010-07-01T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":6,"rating5":4,"pageCount":232,"dateRated":"2010-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2009-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Stephen Chbosky","publisher":"Pocket Books","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"e1e077c4-beff-5ff7-a694-63981b0a540c","childImageSharp":{"id":"19a1fbb3-5673-56df-bb7e-addf1366383e","h200":{"width":131,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/2f8fe32b1d917d0be81177803b933bd4/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/2f8fe32b1d917d0be81177803b933bd4/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/2f8fe32b1d917d0be81177803b933bd4/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/2f8fe32b1d917d0be81177803b933bd4/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":197,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/2f8fe32b1d917d0be81177803b933bd4/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/2f8fe32b1d917d0be81177803b933bd4/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":262,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/2f8fe32b1d917d0be81177803b933bd4/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/2f8fe32b1d917d0be81177803b933bd4/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#BF6F40","darkVibrant":"#633A21","lightVibrant":"#E2BEA9","muted":"#887D78","darkMuted":"#3F3430","lightMuted":"#C8ACA7"}}},"html":"","relatedBooks":[{"id":"25bf5808-9e24-53ff-8d73-028245b5b2a1","fields":{"slug":"/book/turtles-all-the-way-down-john-green"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Turtles All the Way Down","author":"John Green","rating7":5,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":236,"image":{"id":"04739f5a-94c3-5657-a790-0d2ddcfe441e","childImageSharp":{"id":"f5dc96e8-f167-57c0-93f4-bc8a194a3fca","h150":{"width":98,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":229,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/ec9b07c11d4aff9c7c3634b5c805c1b9/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#FC6C04","darkVibrant":"#853C14","lightVibrant":"#EEC691","muted":"#90826C","darkMuted":"#474636","lightMuted":"#DCD0B4"}}},"video":null},{"id":"96fdf754-fb85-51c7-ac9d-5dd35ce44d14","fields":{"slug":"/book/the-disappearances-emily-bain-murphy"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Disappearances","author":"Emily Bain Murphy","rating7":4,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"9c4998f5-9dd0-514f-9792-71a119de5f67","childImageSharp":{"id":"db8edab2-1083-51b7-8188-edf6b2b84346","h150":{"width":97,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/ce9aa83fe80f71a09733a2397f4feae1/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/ce9aa83fe80f71a09733a2397f4feae1/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/ce9aa83fe80f71a09733a2397f4feae1/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/ce9aa83fe80f71a09733a2397f4feae1/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":227,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/ce9aa83fe80f71a09733a2397f4feae1/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/ce9aa83fe80f71a09733a2397f4feae1/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#54A4D4","darkVibrant":"#244C64","lightVibrant":"#84C9E5","muted":"#517FAB","darkMuted":"#344464","lightMuted":"#C0C9CF"}}},"video":null},{"id":"d0c4e5fd-1c67-5f7f-bca2-f9bc89ec65e6","fields":{"slug":"/book/enders-game-orson-scott-card"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ender's Game","author":"Orson Scott Card","rating7":2,"dateReviewed":"2017-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","bookHeight":150,"image":{"id":"bc89939a-90c9-5aef-82aa-738706656e76","childImageSharp":{"id":"9b8efdd0-fe89-5854-9ea1-6489688dd59c","h150":{"width":91,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/4cbba87718e26c483250f005a8450a4b/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/4cbba87718e26c483250f005a8450a4b/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/4cbba87718e26c483250f005a8450a4b/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/4cbba87718e26c483250f005a8450a4b/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":213,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/4cbba87718e26c483250f005a8450a4b/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/4cbba87718e26c483250f005a8450a4b/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D81B21","darkVibrant":"#9B121A","lightVibrant":"#DA9492","muted":"#9B9358","darkMuted":"#63603C","lightMuted":"#BEBEAB"}}},"video":null},{"id":"c41ca31a-394e-5736-9948-0c6389d37360","fields":{"slug":"/book/prince-caspian-cs-lewis"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prince Caspian","author":"C.S.
