Facing almost certain death, the human survivors of a deep-space crash are determined to ignore the odds and colonize an inhospitable planet, recreating a civilization like the one they have lost forever. Only one woman rejects this path, choosing instead a daring and desperate alternative: to practice the art of dying. But her fellow passengers require her reproductive skills for their survival plan, and they are prepared to impose their regime by force if necessaryâ€¦\nJoanna Russ offers an electrifying, original and challenging exploration of individual freedom, power, and our most primitive will to live.\nWe Who Are About To is part of the Penguin Worlds classic science fiction series\n","tags":["genre-science-fiction","sub-feminism","type-fiction","form-paperback","sub-space"],"readDates":[["2017-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","2017-07-14T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":2,"rating5":2,"pageCount":144,"dateRated":"2017-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2016-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2017-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Joanna Russ","image":{"id":"19086432-29ea-549c-bdd6-a74335852b7c","childImageSharp":{"id":"be7178f2-63d2-53bf-abc2-cd5af8622332","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/170082b61c0a3077df3d33691d7e6955/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/170082b61c0a3077df3d33691d7e6955/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/170082b61c0a3077df3d33691d7e6955/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/170082b61c0a3077df3d33691d7e6955/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}}}},"html":"<p>Found this book pretty insufferable, especially towards the end, despite its interesting premise and voice.
