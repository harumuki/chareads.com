Showing how a young man's life is transformed by a mysterious series of events - an encounter with an escaped prisoner; a visit to a black-hearted old woman and a beautiful girl; a fortune from a secret donor - Dickens' late novel is a masterpiece of psychological and moral truth, and Pip among his greatest creations.\n","tags":["genre-pre-war-classic","type-fiction","form-paperback","book-club"],"readDates":[["2019-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":3,"pageCount":571,"dateRated":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2012-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Charles Dickens","image":{"id":"ad33a0d1-f9bc-56c2-a9c7-f3cebb06a555","childImageSharp":{"id":"dcba41c0-d2ea-5493-9b91-62bf3414c5ab","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/7569a585f28c3162b08fb588ce277058/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/7569a585f28c3162b08fb588ce277058/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/7569a585f28c3162b08fb588ce277058/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/7569a585f28c3162b08fb588ce277058/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}}}},"html":"<p>Didn’t quite finish it in 2019, but making a strong start to 2020 (incidentally a year for which I have great expectations). I want to make a habit of reading a Dickens around Christmas, there’s something festive about old English good fortune and hardship. Miss Havisham is iconic, and I loved Pip’s progress through the book.
