It is his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and there are spells to be learnt and (unluckily) Potions and Divination lessons to be attended. But Harry can't know that the atmosphere is darkening around him, and his worst enemy is preparing a fate that it seems will be inescapable â€¦With characteristic wit, fast-paced humour and marvellous emotional depth, J.K. Rowling has proved herself yet again to be a master story-teller.\n","tags":["type-fiction"],"readDates":[["2018-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","2018-11-30T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":null,"pageCount":636,"dateRated":null,"dateBookPublished":"2000-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"J.K.
