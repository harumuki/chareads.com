The London he walks is crammed with groups of men and women needing help, some ready to prey on those who can still see. But another menace stalks blind and sighted alike. With nobody to stop their spread the Triffids, mobile plants with lethal stingers and carnivorous appetites, seem set to take control.\nThe Day of the Triffids is perhaps the most famous catastrophe novel of the twentieth century and its startling imagery of desolate streets and lurching, lethal plant life retains its power to haunt today.\n","tags":["genre-science-fiction","sub-dystopia","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2014-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","2014-04-30T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":6,"rating5":5,"pageCount":272,"dateRated":"2014-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2008-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2014-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","author":"John Wyndham","image":{"id":"ad446cd8-9cb8-5499-b68e-4e27214547e8","childImageSharp":{"id":"6fdcd682-d140-5467-b2e1-0335cbe378f3","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6441860465116279,"src":"/chareads.com/static/7cb00744b398c8410705c952f4e85ed3/4e12f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/7cb00744b398c8410705c952f4e85ed3/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/7cb00744b398c8410705c952f4e85ed3/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/7cb00744b398c8410705c952f4e85ed3/4e12f/cover.jpg 277w","sizes":"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#ECEC74","darkVibrant":"#757510","lightVibrant":"#F1D8A9","muted":"#839456","darkMuted":"#7C8757","lightMuted":"#D1C8A4"}}},"html":"<p>Discussion/Review Video</p>"},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"25db85bb-aeea-50f9-8510-7be73248484f","title":"The Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham","datePublished":"2014-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2014-04-day-of-triffids-john-wyndham","viewCount":1490},"timestamps":[{"t":2,"book":null},{"t":104,"book":null},{"t":103,"book":null},{"t":148,"book":null},{"t":285,"book":null},{"t":389,"book":null}],"image":{"id":"4ac4454b-64c4-5c12-8f96-d95f5a4799df","childImageSharp":{"id":"4b1c4324-9c05-57ff-b1bf-05fce0cf4d3f","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/fbe12e6b3a15bf1b6defeb5f3ff67ef2/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/fbe12e6b3a15bf1b6defeb5f3ff67ef2/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/fbe12e6b3a15bf1b6defeb5f3ff67ef2/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/fbe12e6b3a15bf1b6defeb5f3ff67ef2/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/fbe12e6b3a15bf1b6defeb5f3ff67ef2/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/fbe12e6b3a15bf1b6defeb5f3ff67ef2/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/fbe12e6b3a15bf1b6defeb5f3ff67ef2/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#7A5526","darkVibrant":"#563916","lightVibrant":"#E3BC90","muted":"#969662","darkMuted":"#645534","lightMuted":"#CEBAAB"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"797841b6-0609-5d2b-bf9d-6a0df69ce7a9"}}}
