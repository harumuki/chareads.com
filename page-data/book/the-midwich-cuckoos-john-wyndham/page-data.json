A day later the object is gone and everyone awakens unharmed - except that all the women in the village are discovered to be pregnant.\nThe resultant children of Midwich do not belong to their parents: all are blond, all are golden-eyed. They grow up too fast and their minds exhibit frightening abilities that give them control over others. This brings them into conflict with the villagers just as a chilling realization dawns on the world outsideâ€¦\nTHE MIDWICH CUCKOOS is the classic tale of aliens in our midst, exploring how we respond when confronted by those who are innately superior to us in every conceivable way.\n","tags":["genre-science-fiction","sub-dystopia","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2015-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","2015-01-04T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":4,"pageCount":224,"dateRated":"2015-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2008-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"John Wyndham","image":{"id":"6a4147ea-836d-517a-94b1-18969a170e6a","childImageSharp":{"id":"f7583bcc-8fac-5008-a060-fbdfcd430eb2","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/2da7dc26941592b89b5eda514dd94e27/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/2da7dc26941592b89b5eda514dd94e27/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/2da7dc26941592b89b5eda514dd94e27/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/2da7dc26941592b89b5eda514dd94e27/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#E4448C","darkVibrant":"#4D271E","lightVibrant":"#F9E3DA","muted":"#AC7454","darkMuted":"#6F4842","lightMuted":"#D0AABC"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"37ec2173-11a7-54a7-8cb3-7ae63c266164","title":"The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham","datePublished":"2015-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2015-01-midwich-cuckoos-john-wyndham"},"timestamps":[{"t":16,"book":null},{"t":142,"book":null},{"t":162,"book":null},{"t":197,"book":null},{"t":258,"book":null},{"t":299,"book":null},{"t":332,"book":null}],"image":{"id":"19192439-f3d8-5652-961d-468e293a6995","childImageSharp":{"id":"4ddf20b6-688d-56a1-a11b-153bac4bf047","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/beaf347e6b1cd64be0db59a44069ea56/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/beaf347e6b1cd64be0db59a44069ea56/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/beaf347e6b1cd64be0db59a44069ea56/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/beaf347e6b1cd64be0db59a44069ea56/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/beaf347e6b1cd64be0db59a44069ea56/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/beaf347e6b1cd64be0db59a44069ea56/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/beaf347e6b1cd64be0db59a44069ea56/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#B43E74","darkVibrant":"#1B283D","lightVibrant":"#DD9CBA","muted":"#917675","darkMuted":"#313956","lightMuted":"#A5AEC1"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"013033fc-a56d-54ad-bd29-6fb349689fb0"}}}
