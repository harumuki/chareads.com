Forster's first novel is a witty comedy of manners that is tinged with tragedy. It tells the story of Lilia Herriton, who proves to be an embarrasment to her late husband's family as, in the small Tuscan town of Monteriano, she begins a relationship with a much younger man - classless, uncouth and highly unsuitable. A subtle attack on decorous Edwardian values and humanely sympathetic portrayal of the clash of two cultures, Where Angels Fear to Tread is also a profound exploration of character and virtue.\n","tags":["type-fiction","form-paperback","pub-english-library"],"readDates":[["2014-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","2014-04-17T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":2,"pageCount":161,"dateRated":"2014-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"E.M.
