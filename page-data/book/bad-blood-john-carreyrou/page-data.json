Winner of the Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award.\n'Chilling . . . Reads like a West Coast version of All the Presidentâ€™s Men.' New York Times Book Review\nThe full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of Theranos, the multibillion-dollar biotech startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end, despite pressure from its charismatic CEO and threats by her lawyers.\nIn 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup \"unicorn\" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood testing significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at more than $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.\nIn Bad Blood, John Carreyrou tells the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a tale of ambition and hubris set amid the bold promises of Silicon Valley.\nNow to be adapted into a film, with Jennifer Lawrence to star.\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","sub-technology","form-paperback","sub-medical","book-club"],"readDates":[["2019-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","2019-03-27T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":3,"pageCount":320,"dateRated":"2019-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2019-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"John Carreyrou","image":{"id":"bcc6269d-2d8c-5fbd-8b59-d21d55ba9175","childImageSharp":{"id":"10b55191-e683-5664-92f5-cfe7809ce75b","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.655,"src":"/chareads.com/static/399cc612ce17a247771fedeadf36b21f/7d99a/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/399cc612ce17a247771fedeadf36b21f/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/399cc612ce17a247771fedeadf36b21f/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/399cc612ce17a247771fedeadf36b21f/7d99a/cover.jpg 262w","sizes":"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D4141C","darkVibrant":"#9D201D","lightVibrant":"#E4A49C","muted":"#894142","darkMuted":"#5C4A49","lightMuted":"#CE9394"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"97eb8009-1f75-59c5-9e10-56f513057e96","title":"March Reviews","datePublished":"2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-03-march-reviews","viewCount":809},"timestamps":[{"t":11,"book":{"id":"02d1704c-cb95-5b16-be29-e720089a60b4"}},{"t":204,"book":{"id":"b1da0472-11b7-59eb-bebc-e161cc6c9a15"}},{"t":340,"book":{"id":"050a1b4a-e267-5173-aed3-9e89acfc281a"}},{"t":485,"book":null},{"t":570,"book":{"id":"0418d1d0-0912-5af2-b732-f1c948236e33"}},{"t":756,"book":{"id":"51ff6345-c831-546c-bee6-80095ca2df58"}},{"t":936,"book":{"id":"3343cc95-016a-54a6-9f46-0accb99bc7f8"}},{"t":1025,"book":{"id":"c6dbd577-cdf0-5f41-b532-62d4659f60e1"}},{"t":1236,"book":{"id":"2d3ed929-39f4-50d5-b8b0-479a378beba0"}}],"image":{"id":"fac07c6d-f565-53bc-a363-0e327c30f97a","childImageSharp":{"id":"46ce50bf-c3bd-5ff1-ac08-a1cd852a588c","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#BC673C","darkVibrant":"#733A2D","lightVibrant":"#D69CAC","muted":"#A66180","darkMuted":"#4C2F31","lightMuted":"#B0BBD4"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51ff6345-c831-546c-bee6-80095ca2df58"}}}
