A rare talent' Marian Keyes\nWhen it comes to the trials and triumphs of becoming a grown up, journalist and former Sunday Times dating columnist Dolly Alderton has seen and tried it all. In her memoir, she vividly recounts falling in love, wrestling with self-sabotage, finding a job, throwing a socially disastrous Rod-Stewart themed house party, getting drunk, getting dumped, realising that Ivan from the corner shop is the only man you've ever been able to rely on, and finding that that your mates are always there at the end of every messy night out. It's a book about bad dates, good friends and - above all else - about recognising that you and you alone are enough.\nGlittering with wit and insight, heart and humour, Dolly Alderton's powerful d√©but weaves together personal stories, satirical observations, a series of lists, recipes, and other vignettes that will strike a chord of recognition with women of every age - while making you laugh until you fall over. Everything I know About Love is about the struggles of early adulthood in all its grubby, hopeful uncertainty.\nA spot-on, wildly funny and sometimes heart-breaking book about growing up, growing older and navigating all kinds of love along the way Praise for Everything I Know About Love 'With courageous honesty, Alderton documents her life up to now, the highs and the lows - the sex, the drugs, the nightmare landlords, the heartaches and the humiliations. Deeply funny, sometimes shocking, and admirably open-hearted and optimistic. Only this writer, in this time, could have made such a mesmerising pattern from mess and colour. A brilliant debut.' Daily Telegraph \n'It's so full of life and laughs - I gobbled up this book. Alderton has built something beautiful and true out of many fragments of daftness' Amy Liptrot I loved its truth, its self awareness, humour and most of all, its heart-spilling generosity. Just when you think it's going one (wonderful) way, it takes you somewhere infinitely more rugged, complicated and all the more affectingly tender. A joy. In short, it's a stone cold classic' Sophie Dahl\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","form-paperback","sub-relationships"],"readDates":[["2019-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","2019-07-08T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":2,"rating5":2,"pageCount":368,"dateRated":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2019-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Dolly
