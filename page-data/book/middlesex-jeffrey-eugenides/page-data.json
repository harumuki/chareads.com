To understand why Calliope is not like other girls, she has to uncover a guilty family secret and the astonishing generic history that turns her to Cal, one of the most audacious and wondrous narrators in contemporary fiction. Lyrical and thrilling, Middlesex is an exhilarating reinvention of the American epic.\n","tags":["type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2012-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","2012-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":529,"dateRated":"2012-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2003-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Jeffrey
