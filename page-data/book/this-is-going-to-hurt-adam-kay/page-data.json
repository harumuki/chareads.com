He kept a diary throughout his training, and This Is Going to Hurt intersperses tales from the front line of the NHS with reflections on the current crisis. The result is a first-hand account of life as a junior doctor in all its joy, pain, sacrifice and maddening bureaucracy, and a love letter to those who might at any moment be holding our lives in their hands.\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","form-audiobook","sub-medical"],"readDates":[["2020-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","2020-01-12T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":3,"pageCount":277,"dateRated":"2020-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2018-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Adam Kay","image":{"id":"5131fc31-4e39-56db-9fbb-0542bcaedd3a","childImageSharp":{"id":"732d244d-3a8e-5a4e-9f67-c10e48ce4fca","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.65,"src":"/chareads.com/static/18db47575293736ab0bce87b10d48c4e/90e08/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/18db47575293736ab0bce87b10d48c4e/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/18db47575293736ab0bce87b10d48c4e/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/18db47575293736ab0bce87b10d48c4e/90e08/cover.jpg 260w","sizes":"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#08A2CF","darkVibrant":"#056688","lightVibrant":"#65C2D2","muted":"#B1A951","darkMuted":"#374B51","lightMuted":"#B4B9C1"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"8ca56f2a-c091-55f5-abb8-6a8f0bf83af6","title":"January Wrap-Up","datePublished":"2020-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2020-02-january-wrap-up"},"timestamps":[{"t":81,"book":{"id":"0ad895f1-f520-521e-809a-6fac96170873"}},{"t":197,"book":{"id":"e8289f51-bae9-593c-87de-a90c8d5d3800"}},{"t":216,"book":null},{"t":265,"book":{"id":"73ea73a9-77b3-53c1-80be-9951f7514e9c"}},{"t":291,"book":{"id":"2d0c149b-8848-5cf9-a37c-6dbc43a745a7"}},{"t":316,"book":{"id":"23e9d7ea-8593-5651-980c-f4285dcf3030"}},{"t":350,"book":{"id":"e9aee48b-c410-5a16-8d26-b7f4e1a4b4bd"}},{"t":406,"book":null},{"t":465,"book":null},{"t":495,"book":null}],"image":{"id":"93f3b625-5ce1-52da-94ec-0100f134d187","childImageSharp":{"id":"2e34370a-4137-5340-a1e5-f972d56472c1","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/8e2fb6a9590d87f312d19bee4e941431/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/8e2fb6a9590d87f312d19bee4e941431/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/8e2fb6a9590d87f312d19bee4e941431/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/8e2fb6a9590d87f312d19bee4e941431/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/8e2fb6a9590d87f312d19bee4e941431/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/8e2fb6a9590d87f312d19bee4e941431/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/8e2fb6a9590d87f312d19bee4e941431/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#4494C4","darkVibrant":"#27335E","lightVibrant":"#84E5FA","muted":"#6083AB","darkMuted":"#252841","lightMuted":"#A7B7D0"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0ad895f1-f520-521e-809a-6fac96170873"}}}
