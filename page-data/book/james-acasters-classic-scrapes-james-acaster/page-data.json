Whether it's disappointing a skydiving instructor mid-flight, hiding from thugs in a bush wearing a bright red dress, or annoying the Kettering Board Games club, a didgeridoo-playing conspiracy theorist and some bemused Christians, James is always finding new ways to embarrass himself.\nAppearing on Josh Widdicombe's radio show to recount these stories, the feature was christened 'James Acaster's classic scrapes'. Here, in his first book, James recounts these tales (including never-before-heard stories) along with self-penned drawings, in all their glorious stupidity.\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","form-audiobook"],"readDates":[["2018-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","2018-07-19T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":320,"dateRated":"2018-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2019-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"James Acaster","image":{"id":"b3e433c2-a4f1-5fe2-bda2-2892fd1ed948","childImageSharp":{"id":"e7b26bfa-03c3-55c8-baa3-bf10d5e65cf6","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.65,"src":"/chareads.com/static/d0ab68dabb01305fd8e35c36f788d50e/90e08/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/d0ab68dabb01305fd8e35c36f788d50e/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/d0ab68dabb01305fd8e35c36f788d50e/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/d0ab68dabb01305fd8e35c36f788d50e/90e08/cover.jpg 260w","sizes":"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"80006c4c-7b37-58b2-a992-fb841fb66280"}}}
