Chopin's heart is carried back to Warsaw in secret by his adoring sister. A woman must return to her native Poland in order to poison her terminally ill high school sweetheart, and a young man slowly descends into madness when his wife and child mysteriously vanish during a vacation and just as suddenly reappear. Through these brilliantly imagined characters and stories, interwoven with haunting, playful, and revelatory meditations, Flights explores what it means to be a traveler, a wanderer, a body in motion not only through space but through time. Where are you from? Where are you coming in from? Where are you going? we call to the traveler. Enchanting, unsettling, and wholly original, Flights is a master storyteller's answer.\n","tags":["form-audiobook","genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-ebook","translated","sub-travel","book-club"],"readDates":[["2019-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","2019-05-15T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":4,"pageCount":null,"dateRated":"2019-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":null,"dateReviewed":null,"author":"Olga Tokarczuk","image":{"id":"6b94e8f7-af3f-5736-955d-6c2a0ff41b75","childImageSharp":{"id":"4d5bdee4-ec88-522c-9b06-673ac546b222","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.655,"src":"/chareads.com/static/c389b40239f50b3587d24047d3e3d5da/7d99a/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/c389b40239f50b3587d24047d3e3d5da/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/c389b40239f50b3587d24047d3e3d5da/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/c389b40239f50b3587d24047d3e3d5da/7d99a/cover.jpg 262w","sizes":"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#04349C","darkVibrant":"#043494","lightVibrant":"#A0B4D4","muted":"#5C74AC","darkMuted":"#043495","lightMuted":"#8CA4C8"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"84f8e0f4-9034-5085-8036-9af6bfa48956","title":"May Reviews","datePublished":"2019-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-05-may-reviews"},"timestamps":[{"t":82,"book":{"id":"1f3269a7-76d1-5303-990d-8097f4e0a11c"}},{"t":350,"book":null},{"t":735,"book":{"id":"34d5496f-c346-56c0-9744-3a2faf30fcd1"}},{"t":1056,"book":{"id":"4ea67486-c4a0-5080-a101-6f2f55be7202"}}],"image":{"id":"ffd5a49b-0dae-5b76-a6a1-840dd50fd036","childImageSharp":{"id":"5115154e-a514-5976-97bf-643329331441","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#A9923C","darkVibrant":"#94942E","lightVibrant":"#C5E1F9","muted":"#8E6771","darkMuted":"#4C3033","lightMuted":"#C29FA5"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1f3269a7-76d1-5303-990d-8097f4e0a11c"}}}
