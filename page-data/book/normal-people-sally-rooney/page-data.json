The similarities end there; they are from very different worlds. When they both earn places at Trinity College in Dublin, a connection that has grown between them lasts long into the following years.\nThis is an exquisite love story about how a person can change another person's life - a simple yet profound realisation that unfolds beautifully over the course of the novel. It tells us how difficult it is to talk about how we feel and it tells us - blazingly - about cycles of domination, legitimacy and privilege. Alternating menace with overwhelming tenderness, Sally Rooney's second novel breathes fiction with new life.\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2019-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","2019-05-24T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":4,"pageCount":269,"dateRated":"2019-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2019-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Sally Rooney","image":{"id":"1d985223-a944-53bc-b42a-5cba23121636","childImageSharp":{"id":"5e22285e-b9a2-5a21-aa5b-11b21a293ed3","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6475,"src":"/chareads.com/static/7f3befe8f5faf54840da005b766bd217/0efb0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/7f3befe8f5faf54840da005b766bd217/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/7f3befe8f5faf54840da005b766bd217/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/7f3befe8f5faf54840da005b766bd217/0efb0/cover.jpg 259w","sizes":"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#F46454","darkVibrant":"#15254D","lightVibrant":"#FC6454","muted":"#9A4E52","darkMuted":"#3A3955","lightMuted":"#A9B6C1"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"84f8e0f4-9034-5085-8036-9af6bfa48956","title":"May Reviews","datePublished":"2019-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-05-may-reviews"},"timestamps":[{"t":82,"book":{"id":"1f3269a7-76d1-5303-990d-8097f4e0a11c"}},{"t":350,"book":null},{"t":735,"book":{"id":"34d5496f-c346-56c0-9744-3a2faf30fcd1"}},{"t":1056,"book":{"id":"4ea67486-c4a0-5080-a101-6f2f55be7202"}}],"image":{"id":"ffd5a49b-0dae-5b76-a6a1-840dd50fd036","childImageSharp":{"id":"5115154e-a514-5976-97bf-643329331441","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/102a9eaf9d70b14f738bafd101042958/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#A9923C","darkVibrant":"#94942E","lightVibrant":"#C5E1F9","muted":"#8E6771","darkMuted":"#4C3033","lightMuted":"#C29FA5"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4ea67486-c4a0-5080-a101-6f2f55be7202"}}}
