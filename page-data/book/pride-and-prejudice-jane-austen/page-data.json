When she later discovers that Darcy has involved himself in the troubled relationship between his friend Bingley and her beloved sister Jane, she is determined to dislike him more than ever. In the sparkling comedy of manners that follows, Jane Austen shows the folly of judging by first impressions and superbly evokes the friendships,gossip and snobberies of provincial middle-class life.\n","tags":["genre-pre-war-classic","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2014-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","2014-04-21T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":null,"pageCount":435,"dateRated":null,"dateBookPublished":"2008-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Jane Austen","image":{"id":"cce7dc62-357f-5da5-9e7f-6a9abd166630","childImageSharp":{"id":"7a3135c5-b462-586d-b323-3fda5ed80019","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.645,"src":"/chareads.com/static/c8664424a9c0fe4d141d065fe67a0624/ad21e/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/c8664424a9c0fe4d141d065fe67a0624/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/c8664424a9c0fe4d141d065fe67a0624/ad21e/cover.jpg 129w","sizes":"(max-width: 129px) 100vw, 129px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"a9efca6f-8de0-5183-b83c-cc045114c8b3"}}}
