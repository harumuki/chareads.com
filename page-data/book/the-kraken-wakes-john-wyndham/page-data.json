Then ships began sinking mysteriously and later 'sea tanks' emerged from the deeps to claim people . . .\nFor journalists Mike and Phyllis Watson, what at first appears to be a curiosity becomes a global calamity. Helpless, they watch as humanity struggles to survive now that water - one of the compounds upon which life depends - is turned against them. Finally, sea levels begin their inexorable rise . . .\nThe Kraken Wakes is a brilliant novel of how humankind responds to the threat of its own extinction and, ultimately, asks what we are prepared to do in order to survive.\n","tags":["genre-science-fiction","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2015-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","2015-12-28T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":240,"dateRated":"2015-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2008-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"John Wyndham","image":{"id":"e4216b72-3d5c-5bda-a1d6-b16156be1496","childImageSharp":{"id":"d6f15b27-941d-5ba1-bc3f-c53f2c3fa969","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/af777b5db884c41e2b42b12926ee7837/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/af777b5db884c41e2b42b12926ee7837/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/af777b5db884c41e2b42b12926ee7837/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/af777b5db884c41e2b42b12926ee7837/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#4084B7","darkVibrant":"#08334F","lightVibrant":"#7CACE4","muted":"#5288B0","darkMuted":"#31525E","lightMuted":"#CAA598"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"acd9b88f-df4c-5894-bf1a-7e8887815d39"}}}
