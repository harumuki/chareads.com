They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization, and helped make us who we are.\nOne of the greatest explorations of sin, epiphany and redemption ever written, the Confessions of Saint Augustine continue to shape our ideas with their passionate declaration of the life-changing power of faith.\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","pub-great-ideas","sub-theology","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2014-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","2014-11-12T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":2,"pageCount":114,"dateRated":"2014-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2004-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2014-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Augustine
