Little Black Classics celebrate the huge range and diversity of Penguin Classics, with books from around the world and across many centuries. They take us from a balloon ride over Victorian London to a garden of blossom in Japan, from Tierra del Fuego to 16th-century California and the Russian steppe. Here are stories lyrical and savage; poems epic and intimate; essays satirical and inspirational; and ideas that have shaped the lives of millions. \nAnton Chekhov (1860-1904). \nChekhov's works available in Penguin Classics are The Steppe and Other Stories, Ward No. 6 and Other Stories, The Lady with the Little Dog and Other Stories, The Shooting Party, Plays and A Life in Letters.\n","tags":["type-short-stories","type-fiction","form-paperback","translated","pub-little-black-classics"],"readDates":[["2015-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","2015-02-27T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":4,"pageCount":55,"dateRated":"2015-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2015-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2015-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Anton Chekhov","publisher":"Penguin Classics","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"4c47371c-be8e-5b01-b0af-24c88a45d301","childImageSharp":{"id":"b0ea5c6b-77a0-598d-a062-b02fcb6328d5","h200":{"width":125,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/0d9a6510064ecb1f3a56640dbe11f78c/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/0d9a6510064ecb1f3a56640dbe11f78c/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/0d9a6510064ecb1f3a56640dbe11f78c/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/0d9a6510064ecb1f3a56640dbe11f78c/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":188,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/0d9a6510064ecb1f3a56640dbe11f78c/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/0d9a6510064ecb1f3a56640dbe11f78c/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":250,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/0d9a6510064ecb1f3a56640dbe11f78c/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/0d9a6510064ecb1f3a56640dbe11f78c/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#047CA3","darkVibrant":"#0674A1","lightVibrant":"#EE5883","muted":"#6591B3","darkMuted":"#55682F","lightMuted":"#91A3C4"}}},"html":"<p>Three touching short stories.
