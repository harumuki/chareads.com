He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden prostitute, can offer the chance of redemption.\n","tags":["genre-pre-war-classic","type-fiction","form-paperback","translated","pub-penguin-classics","book-club"],"readDates":[["2012-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","2012-04-08T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":4,"pageCount":671,"dateRated":"2012-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2002-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","image":{"id":"2722009d-879d-5192-9785-39fcf1a96335","childImageSharp":{"id":"fb73a041-519e-5a97-9921-7b43ef940bcc","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.8953488372093024,"src":"/chareads.com/static/e1bb6a63ceff539a940bc5c5a17b302c/e2eab/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/e1bb6a63ceff539a940bc5c5a17b302c/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/e1bb6a63ceff539a940bc5c5a17b302c/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/e1bb6a63ceff539a940bc5c5a17b302c/e2eab/cover.jpg 385w","sizes":"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#B46454","darkVibrant":"#5C3128","lightVibrant":"#F4E3B9","muted":"#B8645C","darkMuted":"#3C3C44","lightMuted":"#BDA294"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5851607d-766e-5938-8526-4134bbb43c6a"}}}
