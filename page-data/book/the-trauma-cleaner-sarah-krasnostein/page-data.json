Sarah Krasnostein's The Trauma Cleaner is a love letter to an extraordinary ordinary life. In Sandra Pankhurst she discovered a woman capable of taking a lifetime of hostility and transphobic abuse and using it to care for some of society's most in-need people. \nSandra Pankhurst founded her trauma cleaning business to help people whose emotional scars are written on their houses. From the forgotten flat of a drug addict to the infested home of a hoarder, Sandra enters properties and lives at the same time. But few of the people she looks after know anything of the complexity of Sandra's own life. Raised in an uncaring home, Sandra's miraculous gift for warmth and humour in the face of unspeakable personal tragedy mark her out as a one-off.\nThis is a truly unique book, taking the humanity of S-Town, the beauty of H Is for Hawk and the sensitivity of When Breath Becomes Air to create something of startling originality. \nAbout the author\nSarah Krasnostein is a writer and a lawyer with a doctorate in criminal law. A fourth generation American and a third generation Australian, she has lived and worked in both countries. She lives in Melbourne and spends part of the year working in New York City. The Trauma Cleaner (Text Publishing / St Martin's Press) is her first book.\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","form-audiobook","on-loan","sub-death","sub-grief"],"readDates":[["2020-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","2020-02-28T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":6,"rating5":5,"pageCount":272,"dateRated":"2020-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2017-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2020-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Sarah Krasnostein","publisher":"Text Publishing","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"5f787687-5ee2-59bc-8cbb-8393a5d3686a","childImageSharp":{"id":"b2b7c7f8-d3bd-519d-a812-a18d315a1a28","h200":{"width":131,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/ca7bd8c7f177a1209f047509d94a1a34/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/ca7bd8c7f177a1209f047509d94a1a34/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/ca7bd8c7f177a1209f047509d94a1a34/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/ca7bd8c7f177a1209f047509d94a1a34/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":196,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/ca7bd8c7f177a1209f047509d94a1a34/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/ca7bd8c7f177a1209f047509d94a1a34/02d26/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/ca7bd8c7f177a1209f047509d94a1a34/f2a7d/cover.jpg 1.5x"},"h400":{"width":262,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/ca7bd8c7f177a1209f047509d94a1a34/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/ca7bd8c7f177a1209f047509d94a1a34/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#F4622A","darkVibrant":"#8A2C20","lightVibrant":"#E89C70","muted":"#A3745C","darkMuted":"#945C44","lightMuted":"#D0BFB4"}},"html":"<p>This was an emotive and sometimes shocking read. Itâ€™s the real-life tale of Sandra Pankhurst: her hard-knock upbringing, coming out as trans, living as a sex worker, and her uncountable personal tragedies. Sandra now runs a business doing industrial cleaning after deaths and in hoarder/squalor situations, and in this book the stories from her past are peppered with client interactions from the present day. This book is a fantastic study on human connection, struggle, autonomy and chiefly, compassion.\nI made a video which goes into more
