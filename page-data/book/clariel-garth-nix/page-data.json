She misses roaming freely within the forests of Estwael, and she feels trapped within the stone city walls. And in Belisaere she is forced to follow the plans, plots and demands of everyone, from her parents to her maid, to the sinister Guildmaster Kilp. Clariel can see her freedom slipping away. It seems too that the city itself is descending into chaos, as the ancient rules binding Abhorsen, King and Clayr appear to be disintegrating.\nWith the discovery of a dangerous Free Magic creature loose in the city, Clariel is given the chance both to prove her worth and make her escape. But events spin rapidly out of control. Clariel finds herself more trapped than ever, until help comes from an unlikely source. But the help comes at a terrible cost. Clariel must question the motivations and secret hearts of everyone around her - and it is herself she must question most of all.\n[This is an alternative edition of ASIN B00KK6FK40]\n","tags":["genre-fantasy","genre-young-adult","type-fiction","form-hardback"],"readDates":[["2014-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","2014-10-08T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":3,"pageCount":480,"dateRated":"2014-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2014-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2014-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Garth Nix","publisher":"Hot Key Books","bookHeight":236,"image":{"id":"cf4a04d5-b4c2-56c9-9f2e-3afe112e15d5","childImageSharp":{"id":"8f61c3ea-dff9-596a-aa9d-46ba1d669950","h200":{"width":151,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/a5fdf5c89240bc501ef392911bcbd6cc/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/a5fdf5c89240bc501ef392911bcbd6cc/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/a5fdf5c89240bc501ef392911bcbd6cc/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/a5fdf5c89240bc501ef392911bcbd6cc/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":227,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/a5fdf5c89240bc501ef392911bcbd6cc/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/a5fdf5c89240bc501ef392911bcbd6cc/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":302,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/a5fdf5c89240bc501ef392911bcbd6cc/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/a5fdf5c89240bc501ef392911bcbd6cc/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#B86548","darkVibrant":"#603425","lightVibrant":"#DCB69E","muted":"#AC5C5C","darkMuted":"#6E3C2B","lightMuted":"#BD8F80"}}},"html":"<p>Video review/discussion <a href=\"http://youtu.be/KipVcbWzKMM\">http://youtu.be/KipVcbWzKMM</a> Talking about magical ethics, cartography and the beautiful lack of romance.</p>","relatedBooks":[{"id":"f481a30b-ca95-576f-9daf-aa761767e534","fields":{"slug":"/book/sabriel-garth-nix"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sabriel","author":"Garth Nix","rating7":null,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"95356520-eb39-5603-964a-8ed2e7c16a9f","childImageSharp":{"id":"8d8ae3d3-7706-5430-82e0-1ec2cb1885a9","h150":{"width":101,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/d92940e79f7570a25d0adab3d676f1dd/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/d92940e79f7570a25d0adab3d676f1dd/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/d92940e79f7570a25d0adab3d676f1dd/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/d92940e79f7570a25d0adab3d676f1dd/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":236,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/d92940e79f7570a25d0adab3d676f1dd/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/d92940e79f7570a25d0adab3d676f1dd/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D18B2B","darkVibrant":"#743C1E","lightVibrant":"#FCF4AD","muted":"#A48474","darkMuted":"#7A3F1F","lightMuted":"#CFC2B0"}}},"video":null},{"id":"1a65d6a9-a047-5851-b618-e298599267e5","fields":{"slug":"/book/lirael-garth-nix"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lirael","author":"Garth Nix","rating7":null,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"dca2f9e1-aca0-5036-820b-e90a95a377e2","childImageSharp":{"id":"6cbb13bd-fd1a-588c-a970-cfa6a0efc3d1","h150":{"width":99,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/685c32ed132361bf2d3511de435419f7/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/685c32ed132361bf2d3511de435419f7/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/685c32ed132361bf2d3511de435419f7/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/685c32ed132361bf2d3511de435419f7/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":232,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/685c32ed132361bf2d3511de435419f7/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/685c32ed132361bf2d3511de435419f7/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#2C7CC4","darkVibrant":"#1B4A61","lightVibrant":"#A7DFEF","muted":"#416E97","darkMuted":"#2B374D","lightMuted":"#849099"}}},"video":null},{"id":"0c518df5-4b92-53ae-a800-2dc1d3ab1d3a","fields":{"slug":"/book/abhorsen-garth-nix"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Abhorsen","author":"Garth Nix","rating7":null,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"62dad157-e368-5e7d-ac24-0f0a0d9e3c9c","childImageSharp":{"id":"07012616-84eb-5c1b-902e-5c78acef1019","h150":{"width":99,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/c4b8d6e214430ada0ac7845b98bb798b/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/c4b8d6e214430ada0ac7845b98bb798b/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/c4b8d6e214430ada0ac7845b98bb798b/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/c4b8d6e214430ada0ac7845b98bb798b/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":231,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/c4b8d6e214430ada0ac7845b98bb798b/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/c4b8d6e214430ada0ac7845b98bb798b/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#B7051C","darkVibrant":"#780515","lightVibrant":"#D2A06E","muted":"#9A7159","darkMuted":"#4F352C","lightMuted":"#754D24"}}},"video":null},{"id":"c41ca31a-394e-5736-9948-0c6389d37360","fields":{"slug":"/book/prince-caspian-cs-lewis"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prince Caspian","author":"C.S.
