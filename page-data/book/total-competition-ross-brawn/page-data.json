Leading Benetton, Ferrari, Honda, Brawn and Mercedes, he worked with drivers such as Michael Schumacher, Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton to make them world champions. In 2017, he was appointed F1's managing director, motor sports, by the sport's new owners Liberty Media. Now, in this fascinating book written with Adam Parr (who was CEO and then chairman of Williams for five years), he looks back over his career and methods to assess how he did it, and where occasionally he got things wrong. \nTotal Competition is a definitive portrait of modern motorsport. In the book, Brawn and Parr explore the unique pressures of Formula One, their battles with Bernie Ecclestone, and the cut-throat world they inhabited, where coming second is never good enough. This book will appeal not only to the millions of Formula One fans who want to understand how Brawn operates, it will also provide many lessons in how to achieve your own business goals. \n'A must-have insight into the awe-inspiring career of a true motor racing great' Daily Express\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","form-audiobook","sub-business-productivity","sub-sport"],"readDates":[["2018-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","2018-09-05T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":2,"pageCount":320,"dateRated":"2018-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2016-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Ross Brawn","image":{"id":"b3a5fd2e-4090-50d8-babf-236aedef7c40","childImageSharp":{"id":"3a0cfd4f-ca42-50d9-9834-a5a4f0847e80","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/d4a9bedf6f1f92cf1bfa9346746014fb/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/d4a9bedf6f1f92cf1bfa9346746014fb/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/d4a9bedf6f1f92cf1bfa9346746014fb/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/d4a9bedf6f1f92cf1bfa9346746014fb/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D31414","darkVibrant":"#7F1416","lightVibrant":"#E49C99","muted":"#A46054","darkMuted":"#4E4C42","lightMuted":"#DDB4B0"}}},"html":"","relatedBooks":[{"id":"8487ce8f-0498-5bc6-ad46-2021ad811bd8","fields":{"slug":"/book/blink-malcolm-gladwell"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blink","author":"Malcolm Gladwell","rating7":null,"dateReviewed":null,"image":{"id":"f2e1b1b1-4f9a-5131-b8d6-6b916de76556","childImageSharp":{"id":"5c36f5e8-6829-5f04-946f-4b32081a4f25","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6575,"src":"/chareads.com/static/2034a31d1b5a52fd3edf1deafcb2f78a/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/2034a31d1b5a52fd3edf1deafcb2f78a/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/2034a31d1b5a52fd3edf1deafcb2f78a/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/2034a31d1b5a52fd3edf1deafcb2f78a/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/2034a31d1b5a52fd3edf1deafcb2f78a/53727/cover.jpg 263w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#249CC4","darkVibrant":"#2C728E","lightVibrant":"#81ADC4","muted":"#568CA8","darkMuted":"#3C5C74","lightMuted":"#BEDBDE"}}},"video":null},{"id":"57cba0e4-19a3-5ad0-a0e3-62096a484b85","fields":{"slug":"/book/irrationality-stuart-sutherland"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Irrationality","author":"Stuart Sutherland","rating7":null,"dateReviewed":null,"image":{"id":"c4285f22-3b24-534c-b0cd-00462abccbf8","childImageSharp":{"id":"6a1df4e2-41db-567d-bc41-e4451725b6bf","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6225,"src":"/chareads.com/static/73963e305c5e8806975fd52ce352ac6d/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/73963e305c5e8806975fd52ce352ac6d/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/73963e305c5e8806975fd52ce352ac6d/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/73963e305c5e8806975fd52ce352ac6d/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/73963e305c5e8806975fd52ce352ac6d/5f486/cover.jpg 249w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#ECD12C","darkVibrant":"#163C5C","lightVibrant":"#EBE07B","muted":"#8A9976","darkMuted":"#555635","lightMuted":"#D1D1AA"}}},"video":null},{"id":"7095c32b-8225-531e-9519-879ab84e8127","fields":{"slug":"/book/growth-hacker-marketing-ryan-holiday"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Growth Hacker Marketing","author":"Ryan Holiday","rating7":null,"dateReviewed":null,"image":{"id":"b786dab6-2ee4-5cc2-b839-5284c34d51be","childImageSharp":{"id":"9f184972-3be3-50f6-af1e-ed37e4d49b5e","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6498740554156172,"src":"/chareads.com/static/d4a432f9736a9e4fda08f86652c8426e/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/d4a432f9736a9e4fda08f86652c8426e/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/d4a432f9736a9e4fda08f86652c8426e/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/d4a432f9736a9e4fda08f86652c8426e/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/d4a432f9736a9e4fda08f86652c8426e/944d9/cover.jpg 258w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D7B48D","darkVibrant":"#624422","lightVibrant":"#E4D2B9","muted":"#7A7A79","darkMuted":"#444443","lightMuted":"#C7C3BF"}}},"video":null},{"id":"1bc5802f-97b8-567a-88f9-be2e526e7211","fields":{"slug":"/book/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people-stephen-r-covey"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People","author":"Stephen R.
