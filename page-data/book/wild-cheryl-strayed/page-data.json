In the wake of her mother’s death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life. With no experience or training, driven only by blind will, she would hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State — and she would do it alone. Told with suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.\n","tags":[],"readDates":[["2019-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","2019-08-26T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":7,"rating5":5,"pageCount":315,"dateRated":"2019-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2013-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Cheryl Strayed","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"7abc0583-9c79-5498-867c-597dd534d939","childImageSharp":{"id":"92a109ed-6735-5380-bed4-f54b78ad5ec1","h200":{"width":113,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/a696b210a0b6a5e2cfebc165d6f6c8be/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/a696b210a0b6a5e2cfebc165d6f6c8be/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/a696b210a0b6a5e2cfebc165d6f6c8be/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x"},"h300":{"width":169,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/a696b210a0b6a5e2cfebc165d6f6c8be/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/a696b210a0b6a5e2cfebc165d6f6c8be/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":215,"height":381,"src":"/chareads.com/static/a696b210a0b6a5e2cfebc165d6f6c8be/89ffe/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/a696b210a0b6a5e2cfebc165d6f6c8be/89ffe/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#B17F4C","darkVibrant":"#6A2120","lightVibrant":"#E4A094","muted":"#B58965","darkMuted":"#48403E","lightMuted":"#CEB4B4"}}},"html":"","relatedBooks":[{"id":"b1d2b3ee-fe61-570a-ba89-3bb8e18b8c1e","fields":{"slug":"/book/wild-cheryl-strayed"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Wild","author":"Cheryl Strayed","rating7":7,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"50bdd300-2fd1-50ef-837f-a26802f53014","childImageSharp":{"id":"e9011d5f-2983-5c47-81cb-33d4a4b4cb8a","h150":{"width":92,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/d010e052fe8428999f9fd5b4eb8cb21d/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/d010e052fe8428999f9fd5b4eb8cb21d/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/d010e052fe8428999f9fd5b4eb8cb21d/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/d010e052fe8428999f9fd5b4eb8cb21d/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":215,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/d010e052fe8428999f9fd5b4eb8cb21d/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/d010e052fe8428999f9fd5b4eb8cb21d/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#DA5042","darkVibrant":"#8B4830","lightVibrant":"#E1B187","muted":"#A8897F","darkMuted":"#583C30","lightMuted":"#C6B2B2"}}},"video":null},{"id":"468675a5-15e8-5c01-9c2a-a8f1e06410e0","fields":{"slug":"/book/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-jk-rowling"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows","author":"J.K.
