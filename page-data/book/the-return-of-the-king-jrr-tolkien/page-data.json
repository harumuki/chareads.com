R. R. Tolkien’s masterpiece, “The Lord of the Rings.”\nIn these three books, which form one continuous narrative, Tolkien created the saga of the Hobbits of Middle-earth and the great War of the Rings. Praised by such writers and poets as W. H. Auden, Richard Hughes and C. S. Lewis, “The Lord of the Rings” – that special world of beauty and terror and meaning – holds a secure place among the books that will live. --back cover\n","tags":["genre-fantasy","genre-post-war-classic","form-audiobook","type-fiction"],"readDates":[["2019-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","2019-08-29T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":4,"pageCount":null,"dateRated":"2019-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2002-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"J.R.R.
