Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization, and helped make us who we are.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","pub-great-ideas","sub-theology","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2014-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","2014-11-13T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":1,"pageCount":128,"dateRated":"2014-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2005-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2014-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Thomas à Kempis","image":{"id":"59a954c6-9b13-5ef0-b62e-622d4ad5abd9","childImageSharp":{"id":"e709ff2a-85b8-589e-9249-7d0149b4ffda","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.3100558659217877,"src":"/chareads.com/static/f08c4e596936aabd6c0c7ff00784571e/7d275/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/f08c4e596936aabd6c0c7ff00784571e/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/f08c4e596936aabd6c0c7ff00784571e/7d275/cover.jpg 111w","sizes":"(max-width: 111px) 100vw, 111px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#CC9933","darkVibrant":"#6A501B","lightVibrant":"#FCF9F3","muted":"#8C8A88","darkMuted":"#7A5C1F","lightMuted":"#D4ACAC"}}},"html":"<p>Nope nope.
