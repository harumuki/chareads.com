Over the course of several years, under the influence of her partner, body, family, friends, mysticism and chance, she struggles to make a moral and meaningful choice.\nIn a compellingly direct mode that straddles the forms of the novel and the essay, Motherhood raises radical and essential questions about womanhood, parenthood, and how – and for whom – to live.\n‘Likely to become the defining literary work on the subject’ Guardian\n","tags":["type-fiction","form-paperback","book-club"],"readDates":[["2019-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":3,"pageCount":304,"dateRated":"2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2019-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Sheila Heti","image":{"id":"8089a8be-0c76-5b65-8393-42103585bc14","childImageSharp":{"id":"a202e1de-7c9e-5fa9-8557-58ec0d62be92","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/24986c6278c3b39da33730590f68f60e/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/24986c6278c3b39da33730590f68f60e/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/24986c6278c3b39da33730590f68f60e/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/24986c6278c3b39da33730590f68f60e/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#B84739","darkVibrant":"#65271F","lightVibrant":"#F4A297","muted":"#A56D67","darkMuted":"#752D24","lightMuted":"#C89A97"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"adc4623a-c723-50a4-96ce-44646d3450f8","title":"June Reviews","datePublished":"2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-06-june-reviews","viewCount":869},"timestamps":[{"t":7,"book":{"id":"97e9fba3-cd3e-5841-84ed-b4c678de5e2e"}},{"t":118,"book":null},{"t":288,"book":{"id":"59838099-3474-57d4-a07a-c64778b94cfb"}},{"t":502,"book":null},{"t":820,"book":{"id":"21188a1c-4712-50a2-ae13-ff42db2aaba4"}}],"image":{"id":"acc9738a-99e9-5b73-bac9-e3448096ffa0","childImageSharp":{"id":"fe95de84-2134-5841-89c0-fab0641cad74","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/c0d455fd17b34904a59d55865b03a4dd/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#28389C","darkVibrant":"#6B2F36","lightVibrant":"#CEDEEF","muted":"#7E6975","darkMuted":"#2B3249","lightMuted":"#BABCC5"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21188a1c-4712-50a2-ae13-ff42db2aaba4"}}}
