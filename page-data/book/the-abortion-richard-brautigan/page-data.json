Life's losers, an astonishing number of whom seem to be writers, can bring their manuscripts to the library, where they will be welcomed, registered and shelved. They will not be read, but they will be cherished. In comes Vida, with her manuscript. Her book is about her gorgeous body in which she feels uncomfortable. The librarian makes her feel comfortable, and together they live in the back of the library until a trip to Tijuana changes them in ways neither of them had ever expected.\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2019-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","2019-02-02T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":1,"rating5":1,"pageCount":176,"dateRated":"2019-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2002-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2019-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Richard Brautigan","image":{"id":"98d90e97-eeb8-5a03-a378-d0ff6666b235","childImageSharp":{"id":"01559c50-ca1c-547c-85d5-ee260a347b13","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.65,"src":"/chareads.com/static/7fb8aff4a8ccb383a87afdc034f61324/90e08/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/7fb8aff4a8ccb383a87afdc034f61324/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/7fb8aff4a8ccb383a87afdc034f61324/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/7fb8aff4a8ccb383a87afdc034f61324/90e08/cover.jpg 260w","sizes":"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#0494EC","darkVibrant":"#0C74C2","lightVibrant":"#E5C77D","muted":"#517F9B","darkMuted":"#304E63","lightMuted":"#90BCC0"}}},"html":"<p>I don’t like it when a man writes a story from a man’s perspective about a woman’s body, especially when it includes many passages like “The author was a girl about twelve years old, just entering into puberty.
