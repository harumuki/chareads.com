Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship--like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor--April and her best friend, Andy, make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day, April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world--from Beijing to Buenos Aires--and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight.\nSeizing the opportunity to make her mark on the world, April now has to deal with the consequences her new particular brand of fame has on her relationships, her safety, and her own identity. And all eyes are on April to figure out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us.\nCompulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring for the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye. The beginning of an exciting fiction career, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing is a bold and insightful novel of now.\n","tags":[],"readDates":[["2019-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","2019-11-28T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":null,"pageCount":352,"dateRated":"2019-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2018-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Hank Green","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"7ce2ad84-d759-510d-998e-757d826518c0","childImageSharp":{"id":"8bec3ea7-da26-5bd3-89fb-4c987af47866","h200":{"width":130,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":195,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":260,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#C7D304","darkVibrant":"#042474","lightVibrant":"#F5FD7D","muted":"#7E9F54","darkMuted":"#324F60","lightMuted":"#8E9603"}}},"html":"","relatedBooks":[{"id":"cdc2c507-d384-52d2-adbe-0bb03bb2b635","fields":{"slug":"/book/an-absolutely-remarkable-thing-hank-green"},"frontmatter":{"title":"An Absolutely Remarkable Thing","author":"Hank Green","rating7":5,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"a0ada610-c6e0-564d-b31f-2fe16579c66b","childImageSharp":{"id":"63d495fe-c740-54ba-af79-58093882821d","h150":{"width":98,"height":150,"src":"/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":228,"height":350,"src":"/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/5f2acee7f9867d4649e8b14b1bdae670/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#C7D304","darkVibrant":"#042474","lightVibrant":"#F5FD7D","muted":"#7E9F54","darkMuted":"#324F60","lightMuted":"#8E9603"}}},"video":null},{"id":"468675a5-15e8-5c01-9c2a-a8f1e06410e0","fields":{"slug":"/book/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-jk-rowling"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows","author":"J.K.
