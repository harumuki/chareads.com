When asked simple questions about global trends - why the world's population is increasing; how many young women go to school; how many of us live in poverty - we systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers. In Factfulness, Professor of International Health and a man who can make data sing, Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators Anna and Ola, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens, and reveals the ten instincts that distort our perspective. It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most. Inspiring and revelatory, filled with lively anecdotes and moving stories, Factfulness is an urgent and essential book that will change the way you see the world.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","sub-science","sub-psychology","sub-journalism","form-hardback","sub-medical","on-loan","sub-nature"],"readDates":[["2019-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","2019-01-11T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":3,"pageCount":342,"dateRated":"2019-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2018-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2019-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Hans Rosling","image":{"id":"7257351a-1f3c-5c2c-bb65-faa8287e77fd","childImageSharp":{"id":"85f0e84f-8954-5dae-a37b-8cd10c071709","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6511627906976745,"src":"/chareads.com/static/2ea410a3f516078dfc1d94ba09a91de3/f5783/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/2ea410a3f516078dfc1d94ba09a91de3/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/2ea410a3f516078dfc1d94ba09a91de3/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/2ea410a3f516078dfc1d94ba09a91de3/f5783/cover.jpg 280w","sizes":"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px"}}}},"html":"<p>Solid read about global trends through the lens of a framework for critical data analysis and assumption-busting.
