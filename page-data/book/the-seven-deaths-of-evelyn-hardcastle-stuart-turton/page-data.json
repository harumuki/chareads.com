She's been murdered hundreds of times, and each day, Aiden Bishop is too late to save her. Doomed to repeat the same day over and over, Aiden's only escape is to solve Evelyn Hardcastle's murder and conquer the shadows of an enemy he struggles to even comprehend--but nothing and no one are quite what they seem.\nDeeply atmospheric and ingeniously plotted, The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a highly original debut that will appeal to fans of Kate Atkinson and Agatha Christie.\n","tags":["genre-crime-mystery","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2019-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","2019-03-10T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":3,"rating5":3,"pageCount":528,"dateRated":"2019-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2018-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Stuart Turton","image":{"id":"f2b467b4-b581-5ad0-8bfa-f61d5e471871","childImageSharp":{"id":"72bbab9a-944a-5837-b9e3-3a2d733c695d","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/21f590490856dfc675c5d5be5dfc41bf/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/21f590490856dfc675c5d5be5dfc41bf/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/21f590490856dfc675c5d5be5dfc41bf/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/21f590490856dfc675c5d5be5dfc41bf/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#CF4838","darkVibrant":"#A14533","lightVibrant":"#ECC3A9","muted":"#A96F61","darkMuted":"#59483A","lightMuted":"#D3BEA2"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"97eb8009-1f75-59c5-9e10-56f513057e96","title":"March Reviews","datePublished":"2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-03-march-reviews"},"timestamps":[{"t":11,"book":{"id":"02d1704c-cb95-5b16-be29-e720089a60b4"}},{"t":204,"book":{"id":"b1da0472-11b7-59eb-bebc-e161cc6c9a15"}},{"t":340,"book":{"id":"050a1b4a-e267-5173-aed3-9e89acfc281a"}},{"t":485,"book":null},{"t":570,"book":{"id":"0418d1d0-0912-5af2-b732-f1c948236e33"}},{"t":756,"book":{"id":"51ff6345-c831-546c-bee6-80095ca2df58"}},{"t":936,"book":{"id":"3343cc95-016a-54a6-9f46-0accb99bc7f8"}},{"t":1025,"book":{"id":"c6dbd577-cdf0-5f41-b532-62d4659f60e1"}},{"t":1236,"book":{"id":"2d3ed929-39f4-50d5-b8b0-479a378beba0"}}],"image":{"id":"fac07c6d-f565-53bc-a363-0e327c30f97a","childImageSharp":{"id":"46ce50bf-c3bd-5ff1-ac08-a1cd852a588c","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#BC673C","darkVibrant":"#733A2D","lightVibrant":"#D69CAC","muted":"#A66180","darkMuted":"#4C2F31","lightMuted":"#B0BBD4"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"02d1704c-cb95-5b16-be29-e720089a60b4"}}}
