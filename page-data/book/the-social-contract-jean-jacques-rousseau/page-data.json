Rejecting the view that anyone has a natural right to wield authority over others, Rousseau argues instead for a pact, or ‘social contract’, that should exist between all the citizens of a state and that should be the source of sovereign power. From this fundamental premise, he goes on to consider issues of liberty and law, freedom and justice, arriving at a view of society that has seemed to some a blueprint for totalitarianism, to others a declaration of democratic principles.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","pub-great-ideas","sub-politics","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2014-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","2014-12-18T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":168,"dateRated":"2014-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2006-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Jean-Jacques Rousseau","image":{"id":"d9eaef71-e329-5003-bf7c-16e72ec3f485","childImageSharp":{"id":"c7423e3b-bed0-57b2-b0ce-e3f371785652","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.5873015873015873,"src":"/chareads.com/static/9b3708bf96885e76636b395a46e80307/fd844/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/9b3708bf96885e76636b395a46e80307/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/9b3708bf96885e76636b395a46e80307/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/9b3708bf96885e76636b395a46e80307/fd844/cover.jpg 222w","sizes":"(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"aa24e685-5800-5666-98ce-9292cc00f2e9","title":"Great Ideas #8: The Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau","datePublished":"2014-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2014-12-great-ideas-8-social-contract-jean-jacques"},"timestamps":[{"t":12,"book":null},{"t":26,"book":null},{"t":86,"book":null},{"t":140,"book":null},{"t":159,"book":null},{"t":194,"book":null},{"t":243,"book":null}],"image":{"id":"0402d36b-8c7a-5dac-bc9b-cdd6f6689116","childImageSharp":{"id":"dd6085a2-7eaa-5677-82d6-bff862d8b099","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/486d8dd2bc57a6648a7173621f17cdc0/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/486d8dd2bc57a6648a7173621f17cdc0/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/486d8dd2bc57a6648a7173621f17cdc0/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/486d8dd2bc57a6648a7173621f17cdc0/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/486d8dd2bc57a6648a7173621f17cdc0/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/486d8dd2bc57a6648a7173621f17cdc0/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/486d8dd2bc57a6648a7173621f17cdc0/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"fcf60de2-4dd4-58d7-897a-290b077838fa"}}}
