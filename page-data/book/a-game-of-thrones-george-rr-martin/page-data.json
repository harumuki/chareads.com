Winter can last a lifetime. And the struggle for the Iron Throne has begun.\nAs Warden of the north, Lord Eddard Stark counts it a curse when King Robert bestows on him the office of the Hand. His honour weighs him down at court where a true man does what he will, not what he must … and a dead enemy is a thing of beauty.\nThe old gods have no power in the south, Stark’s family is split and there is treachery at court. Worse, the vengeance-mad heir of the deposed Dragon King has grown to maturity in exile in the Free Cities. He claims the Iron Throne.\n","tags":["genre-fantasy","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2014-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","2014-02-05T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":5,"pageCount":780,"dateRated":"2014-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2011-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"George R.R.
