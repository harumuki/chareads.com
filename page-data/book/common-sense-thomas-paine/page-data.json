They have transformed the way we see ourselves—and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives—and destroyed them.\nPublished anonymously in 1776, six months before the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Paine’s Common Sense was a radical and impassioned call for America to free itself from British rule and set up an independent republican government. Savagely attacking hereditary kingship and aristocratic institutions, Paine urged a new beginning for his adopted country in which personal freedom and social equality would be upheld and economic and cultural progress encouraged. \nHis pamphlet was the first to speak directly to a mass audience—it went through fifty-six editions within a year of publication—and its assertive and often caustic style both embodied the democratic spirit he advocated, and converted thousands of citizens to the cause of American independence.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","pub-great-ideas","sub-politics","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2015-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","2015-02-26T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":104,"dateRated":"2015-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2005-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2015-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Thomas Paine","publisher":"Penguin","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"c7a7903e-9b3e-5a4f-95ab-a379126bb59b","childImageSharp":{"id":"0ab39760-0729-53a0-9ff7-6e920831ea4b","h200":{"width":136,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/438b98cf0b7f0075b5542048c47c9847/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/438b98cf0b7f0075b5542048c47c9847/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/438b98cf0b7f0075b5542048c47c9847/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x"},"h300":{"width":204,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/438b98cf0b7f0075b5542048c47c9847/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/438b98cf0b7f0075b5542048c47c9847/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":211,"height":311,"src":"/chareads.com/static/438b98cf0b7f0075b5542048c47c9847/6450f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/438b98cf0b7f0075b5542048c47c9847/6450f/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#C8376D","darkVibrant":"#681C39","lightVibrant":"#FCF4F7","muted":"#9C7C8C","darkMuted":"#595959","lightMuted":"#C4A4AE"}}},"html":"<p>So I guess I have to admit it’s okay that the Americans fought for independence.
