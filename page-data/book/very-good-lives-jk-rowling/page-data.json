Rowling delivered a deeply affecting commencement speech at Harvard University. Now published for the first time in book form, Very Good Lives offers J.K. Rowling's words of wisdom for anyone at a turning point in life, asking the profound and provocative questions: How can we embrace failure? And how can we use our imagination to better both ourselves and others? \nDrawing from stories of her own post-graduate years, the world-famous author addresses some of life's most important issues with acuity and emotional force. \nSales of Very Good Lives will benefit Lumos, a charity organisation founded by J.K. Rowling, which works to transform the lives of disadvantaged children, and university-wide financial aid at Harvard University.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","sub-quotes","form-hardback"],"readDates":[["2018-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","2019-01-02T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":null,"pageCount":80,"dateRated":null,"dateBookPublished":"2015-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"J.K.
