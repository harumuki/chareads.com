But he soon realizes that they are simply remnants of a once-great culture - now weak and living in terror of the sinister Morlocks lurking in the deep tunnels, who threaten his very return home.\nH. G. Wells defined much of modern science fiction with this 1895 tale of time travel, which questions humanity, society, and our place on Earth.\n","tags":["genre-science-fiction","type-fiction","form-paperback","pub-english-library"],"readDates":[["2014-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","2014-01-22T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":2,"pageCount":106,"dateRated":"2014-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2012-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"H.G.
