But one thing will always be out of his reach â€¦ Everybody who is anybody is seen at his glittering parties. Day and night his Long Island mansion buzzes with bright young things drinking, dancing and debating his mysterious character. For Gatsby - young, handsome, fabulously rich - always seems alone in the crowd, watching and waiting, though no one knows what for. Beneath the shimmering surface of his life he is hiding a secret: a silent longing that can never be fulfilled. And soon this destructive obsession will force his world to unravel.\nThe Penguin English Library - collectable general readers' editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century to the end of the Second World War.\n","tags":["pub-english-library"],"readDates":[["2018-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","2018-12-28T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":null,"pageCount":160,"dateRated":null,"dateBookPublished":"2018-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"F.
