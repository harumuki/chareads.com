These are stories about getting your butt touched by your boss, about friendship and dieting (kind of) and having two existential crises before the age of 20. Stories about travel, both successful and less so, and about having the kind of sex where you feel like keeping your sneakers on in case you have to run away during the act. Stories about proving yourself to a room of 50-year-old men in Hollywood and showing up to \"an outlandishly high-fashion event with the crustiest red nose you ever saw.\" Fearless, smart, and as heartbreakingly honest as ever, Not That Kind of Girl establishes Lena Dunham as more than a hugely talented director, actress and producer-it announces her as a fresh and vibrant new literary voice.\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","form-audiobook","sub-feminism","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2014-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","2014-10-20T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":4,"pageCount":265,"dateRated":"2014-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Lena
