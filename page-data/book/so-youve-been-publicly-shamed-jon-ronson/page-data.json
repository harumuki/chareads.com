The shamed are people like us – people who, say, made a joke on social media that came out badly, or made a mistake at work. Once their transgression is revealed, collective outrage circles with the force of a hurricane and the next thing they know they’re being torn apart by an angry mob, jeered at, demonized, sometimes even fired from their job.\nA great renaissance of public shaming is sweeping our land. Justice has been democratized. The silent majority are getting a voice. But what are we doing with our voice? We are mercilessly finding people’s faults. We are defining the boundaries of normality by ruining the lives of those outside it. We are using shame as a form of social control.\nSimultaneously powerful and hilarious in the way only Jon Ronson can be, So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed is a deeply honest book about modern life, full of eye-opening truths about the escalating war on human flaws – and the very scary part we all play in it.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","form-audiobook"],"readDates":[["2018-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","2018-03-18T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":5,"pageCount":286,"dateRated":"2018-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2015-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2018-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Jon Ronson","image":{"id":"e87c8277-4dc2-54a1-a00d-0172d5d4a7fc","childImageSharp":{"id":"5daffbed-e188-517c-9ea1-18eab108033f","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6596858638743456,"src":"/chareads.com/static/064d5f01e135d37da07510b84ec9fa18/10085/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/064d5f01e135d37da07510b84ec9fa18/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/064d5f01e135d37da07510b84ec9fa18/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/064d5f01e135d37da07510b84ec9fa18/10085/cover.jpg 252w","sizes":"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#049CAC","darkVibrant":"#049CA4","lightVibrant":"#D7E4B7","muted":"#64A9AB","darkMuted":"#463661","lightMuted":"#A3CBC2"}}},"html":"<p>This book shook me, so it’s taken a bit of time to get my thoughts together about it.\nI decided about 2 years ago that I consider shame the worst human emotion, it seems much more hurtful and uncontrollable than worry, fear, even despair to me. Since then I’ve been repulsed by it, anger instantly boils up when I see shaming happen to even the worst kind of people, so this book had me in near-constant flux between a deep sadness for the world and a fury at many of the people in it, neither particularly productive reactions.\nRonson’s writing is a delight, he weaves together these story arcs delicately and without any firm judgement. I thought I’d get annoyed that he’d lean too heavily one way or the other but his commentary remains open and curious, deftly so.\nHonestly though, the primary reason this book captured me so intensely is that a few years ago I became embroiled in (and sat anonymously adjacent to) a public shaming scandal. While I’ve long made my peace with it and with those involved, I still harbour a great shame (irony!) for my actions and their consequences… reliving similar situations in this book felt like high voltage through my veins, and the alternate reality where Jon Ronson spends a hundred pages writing about the nuances of my incident didn’t feel so far afield. And that’s why I’ve put off reading this for so long despite genuinely wanting to, I’ve been afraid to confront those feelings again, but I’m firmly glad-and a little proud-that I did.\nThis book does a fantastic job of describing what public shaming feels like for the 0.001% of participants that actually have to endure it. I suspect the world (but mostly the social internet) would be a much kinder and more pleasant place if the other 99.999% read this book.</p>"},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"a06350f8-36e5-5e6e-ba9e-c0ed4f72229e","title":"6 Months Of Reviews","datePublished":"2018-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2018-05-6-months-of-reviews","viewCount":1963},"timestamps":[{"t":50,"book":null},{"t":75,"book":null},{"t":80,"book":{"id":"7fddc040-376e-5faa-a06e-cae6d488974e"}},{"t":172,"book":{"id":"5dc452f8-2ed9-5e88-be8f-03cd2eb88c28"}},{"t":232,"book":{"id":"7423e908-1902-5bcd-823f-2947787e4196"}},{"t":240,"book":{"id":"cc60b8b3-06a1-5158-aad0-79d30589a400"}},{"t":366,"book":{"id":"0da17b03-5412-5e4a-a74b-523575a483c3"}},{"t":420,"book":null},{"t":535,"book":{"id":"79e7361b-e931-5d0a-9377-f0cfa120f0ed"}},{"t":589,"book":{"id":"1074264c-aad1-5468-a521-683f57e3568f"}},{"t":788,"book":{"id":"7a1339bc-ac7b-5afa-bd21-b6a4b1f9ba6a"}},{"t":840,"book":{"id":"7f849578-aea8-5a64-be13-5a09997d75ed"}},{"t":963,"book":{"id":"e3a7e17c-bd98-5c66-b3b7-9d5a9e1e15f4"}},{"t":1060,"book":{"id":"82a061f0-5682-50cc-b3c3-a33e35d689de"}},{"t":1077,"book":{"id":"9ea21ed0-0b48-5555-b8b1-b59a8801a022"}},{"t":1105,"book":{"id":"8d99ae54-6ca6-59bf-91ce-66fa0dbac3ac"}},{"t":1184,"book":{"id":"1b199a52-8d32-56f8-8a3f-806f5d31b4e9"}},{"t":1184,"book":{"id":"1b199a52-8d32-56f8-8a3f-806f5d31b4e9"}},{"t":1326,"book":{"id":"bbde3728-5c2a-5069-ae3a-2673a2b441b5"}},{"t":1447,"book":null},{"t":1600,"book":null},{"t":1760,"book":{"id":"3f364562-0a93-5616-b436-88193dafaf00"}},{"t":1900,"book":{"id":"e520c7a9-acf7-599c-bd51-2b9b08e47d4c"}},{"t":1990,"book":{"id":"7d3db2cc-1af6-5dff-af29-18a602892fb8"}},{"t":2151,"book":{"id":"4b9b5aff-fd7f-50fc-9a07-123eae9d5904"}},{"t":2160,"book":{"id":"d20f4a5f-2661-50b2-87d2-cdf55cf41e6a"}},{"t":2356,"book":{"id":"2e4f49a8-56bc-5bcf-9fcb-8ad84bf92fe3"}}],"image":{"id":"769cc0c5-de66-5ff5-960f-800955241db1","childImageSharp":{"id":"7dbe94aa-6c5c-5005-ab05-a4fbd5cdb8f4","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/bbae73cc5e84d47b8b501f40f319b071/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#3A8D61","darkVibrant":"#041622","lightVibrant":"#A1D8BB","muted":"#6B7898","darkMuted":"#2E3A61","lightMuted":"#A2ADCE"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e3a7e17c-bd98-5c66-b3b7-9d5a9e1e15f4"}}}
