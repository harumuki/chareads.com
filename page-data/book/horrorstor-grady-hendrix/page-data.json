Every morning, employees arrive to find broken Kjerring bookshelves, shattered Glans water goblets, and smashed Liripip wardrobes. Sales are down, security cameras reveal nothing, and store managers are panicking. To unravel the mystery, three employees volunteer to work a nine-hour dusk-till-dawn shift. In the dead of the night, they’ll patrol the empty showroom floor, investigate strange sights and sounds, and encounter horrors that defy the imagination. A traditional haunted house story in a thoroughly contemporary setting, Horrorstör comes packaged in the form of a glossy mail order catalog, complete with product illustrations, a home delivery order form, and a map of Orsk’s labyrinthine showroom.\nDesigned by Andie Reid, cover photography by Christine Ferrara\n","tags":["genre-horror","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2015-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","2015-10-31T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":3,"rating5":3,"pageCount":248,"dateRated":"2015-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2014-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2015-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Grady Hendrix","image":{"id":"925b6e68-4760-5679-89e3-51a048f95037","childImageSharp":{"id":"d081d857-1b86-5974-ae62-1f0beac9469d","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.8663239074550129,"src":"/chareads.com/static/f66a84833516f084c84c02dfb94c92ae/42d2d/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/f66a84833516f084c84c02dfb94c92ae/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/f66a84833516f084c84c02dfb94c92ae/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/f66a84833516f084c84c02dfb94c92ae/42d2d/cover.jpg 337w","sizes":"(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#F1DF1C","darkVibrant":"#7B502C","lightVibrant":"#C3A782","muted":"#549C9C","darkMuted":"#3D2D20","lightMuted":"#D4C9BA"}}},"html":"<p>LOVED the Ikea-like setting.
