Deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, the Count has been sentenced to house arrest indefinitely.\nWhile Russia undergoes decades of tumultuous upheaval, the Count, stripped of the trappings that defined his life, is forced to question what makes us who we are. And with the assistance of a glamorous actress, a cantankerous chef and a very serious child, Rostov unexpectedly discovers a new understanding of both pleasure and purpose.\n","tags":["type-fiction","form-paperback","genre-historical-fiction","on-loan","book-club"],"readDates":[["2019-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","2019-02-07T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":6,"rating5":5,"pageCount":462,"dateRated":"2019-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2017-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Amor Towles","image":{"id":"7409b4cb-3d7f-55e7-9777-f9011648bac0","childImageSharp":{"id":"ae605603-e8a8-5fef-b620-c6b7d2ce20bd","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6475,"src":"/chareads.com/static/617d850a8384e11604b7cd4df2698068/0efb0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/617d850a8384e11604b7cd4df2698068/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/617d850a8384e11604b7cd4df2698068/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/617d850a8384e11604b7cd4df2698068/0efb0/cover.jpg 259w","sizes":"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#CAB560","darkVibrant":"#635621","lightVibrant":"#E8DDBA","muted":"#AC9454","darkMuted":"#42414E","lightMuted":"#BBBAC1"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"575dbca6-a06a-5c7e-b4d6-df723f3895bf","title":"February Reviews","datePublished":"2019-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-03-february-reviews"},"timestamps":[{"t":30,"book":{"id":"593af826-5aaf-5d02-9819-9e299712ced6"}},{"t":160,"book":{"id":"8eb706de-359f-5ee6-b1c3-35cca959055f"}},{"t":300,"book":{"id":"08e70de0-2467-5517-929b-a369cdad6bfd"}},{"t":520,"book":{"id":"cacfa4e9-a24e-5db1-97fc-14bf999aab14"}}],"image":{"id":"060cc13b-5985-5ee7-b56a-56328f71ecb3","childImageSharp":{"id":"27c8ece2-abbf-5146-a566-b9263a56ed7e","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/5d457d8c02e472932bab27e8db97484d/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/5d457d8c02e472932bab27e8db97484d/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/5d457d8c02e472932bab27e8db97484d/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/5d457d8c02e472932bab27e8db97484d/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/5d457d8c02e472932bab27e8db97484d/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/5d457d8c02e472932bab27e8db97484d/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/5d457d8c02e472932bab27e8db97484d/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#449CCC","darkVibrant":"#713537","lightVibrant":"#99DDF7","muted":"#986A70","darkMuted":"#364156","lightMuted":"#C49EAB"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8eb706de-359f-5ee6-b1c3-35cca959055f"}}}
