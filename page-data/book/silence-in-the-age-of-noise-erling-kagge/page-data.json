But what really is silence? Where can it be found? And why is it more important now than ever?\nErling Kagge, the Norwegian adventurer and polymath, once spent fifty days walking solo in Antarctica with a broken radio. In this meditative, charming and surprisingly powerful book, he explores the power of silence and the importance of shutting out the world. Whether you're in deep wilderness, taking a shower or on the dance floor, you can experience perfect stillness if you know where to look. And from it grows self-knowledge, gratitude, wonder and much more.\nTake a deep breath, and prepare to submerge yourself in Silence. Your own South Pole is out there, somewhere.\n'As an explorer Erling Kagge is world class; as a writer he is equally gifted. This breathtaking, inspiring little book teaches us how to find precious moments of silence - whether we are crossing the Antarctic, climbing Everest, or on the train at rush hour' - Sir Ranulph Fiennes\n'Silence braces a space within which we can hear ourselves think. Quietly, wisely, it makes a case for dumbing the din of modern life, and learning to listen again. Drawing on the experiences of Kagge's extraordinary life in wild places, this is a book of great concentration' - Robert Macfarlane\n'Erling Kagge is a philosophical adventurer - or perhaps an adventurous philosopher' - New York Times\n'A breathtakingly beautiful, quietly life-changing book by the Norwegian explorer Erling Kagge, that shows us how to find perfect silence in our daily lives - however busy we are' - Publisher's description\n","tags":[],"readDates":[["2019-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","2019-05-03T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":3,"pageCount":147,"dateRated":"2019-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Erling Kagge","publisher":"Penguin","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"6076641f-792f-551e-acc8-0dd06ee1eeac","childImageSharp":{"id":"1866cc32-ac2a-5c90-b7f6-3ed3a68d4c34","h200":{"width":143,"height":200,"src":"/chareads.com/static/4d62cc2fd5b36f3ac4efa8be2683eba6/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/4d62cc2fd5b36f3ac4efa8be2683eba6/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/chareads.com/static/4d62cc2fd5b36f3ac4efa8be2683eba6/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/chareads.com/static/4d62cc2fd5b36f3ac4efa8be2683eba6/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":215,"height":300,"src":"/chareads.com/static/4d62cc2fd5b36f3ac4efa8be2683eba6/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/4d62cc2fd5b36f3ac4efa8be2683eba6/02d26/cover.jpg 1x"},"h400":{"width":286,"height":400,"src":"/chareads.com/static/4d62cc2fd5b36f3ac4efa8be2683eba6/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/4d62cc2fd5b36f3ac4efa8be2683eba6/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#DC8454","darkVibrant":"#6E3517","lightVibrant":"#D4ECFC","muted":"#AE7E60","darkMuted":"#765649","lightMuted":"#A3BFD0"}}},"html":"","relatedBooks":[{"id":"468675a5-15e8-5c01-9c2a-a8f1e06410e0","fields":{"slug":"/book/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-jk-rowling"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows","author":"J.K.
