Correspondingly, the stories are littered with the physical ephemera of language: dictionaries, dog-eared pages, bookmarks and old coffee stains on older books. This is writing that centres on the weird, tender intricacies of the everyday where characters vie to 'own' their words, tell tall tales and attempt to define their worlds. \nWith affectionate, irreverent and playful prose, the inability to communicate exactly what we mean dominates this bold debut collection from one of Britain’s most original new writers.\n","tags":["type-short-stories","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2019-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","2019-01-31T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":6,"rating5":4,"pageCount":176,"dateRated":"2019-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2017-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Eley Williams","image":{"id":"fdd182c0-6cbd-58b4-888f-6ef4a88c614e","childImageSharp":{"id":"00ecb956-8fdc-50b9-bda3-458605c683f5","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.781437125748503,"src":"/chareads.com/static/03e3a16468dc2edd894c001c7f79e131/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/03e3a16468dc2edd894c001c7f79e131/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/03e3a16468dc2edd894c001c7f79e131/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/03e3a16468dc2edd894c001c7f79e131/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"9dda4276-340b-56e4-8ae7-e6fdc8216624","title":"January Reviews","datePublished":"2019-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-01-january-reviews"},"timestamps":[{"t":55,"book":{"id":"3c974144-d76b-5073-b978-4c23f03f8641"}},{"t":168,"book":{"id":"2fdc8d03-636e-54fe-b162-2e37916fe6fc"}},{"t":262,"book":{"id":"3883f63d-e524-52ba-96bb-f6e08810a512"}},{"t":425,"book":{"id":"10815bbf-5623-5928-8f56-e3c833390a2b"}},{"t":569,"book":null},{"t":657,"book":{"id":"07cc5e61-55f2-5307-a4c2-66a1aeab4a2b"}},{"t":788,"book":{"id":"27c19df9-8a55-5d6a-adf9-45028e0f497d"}},{"t":980,"book":{"id":"7346a900-c630-5d37-90d6-eca78dd6f8ce"}},{"t":1157,"book":{"id":"007e5432-17cd-5553-8c8c-7ee650d253c8"}}],"image":{"id":"33a6208b-915a-5f54-85ab-b782b2cefd29","childImageSharp":{"id":"dfc52098-09f6-5401-80a0-a746969c7a9e","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/285d1ca83295ec00d870f7edafbfeb36/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/285d1ca83295ec00d870f7edafbfeb36/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/285d1ca83295ec00d870f7edafbfeb36/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/285d1ca83295ec00d870f7edafbfeb36/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/285d1ca83295ec00d870f7edafbfeb36/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/285d1ca83295ec00d870f7edafbfeb36/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/285d1ca83295ec00d870f7edafbfeb36/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"007e5432-17cd-5553-8c8c-7ee650d253c8"}}}
