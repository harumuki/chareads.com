In Hollywood, a movie is given a single weekend to succeed before being written off. In Silicon Valley, a startup is a failure if it doesn't go viral or rake in venture capital from the start. In publishing, a book that took years to write is given less than three months to sink or swim. These brutally shortsighted attitudes have choked the world with instructions for engineering a flash-in-the-pan and littered the media landscape with fads and flops. Meanwhile, the greats, the stalwarts, the household names, are those who focus on a singularly different, possibly heretical, idea: that their work can and should last. For instance, Zildjian has been one of the premier makers of cymbals since its founding in 1623--and shows no signs of quitting. Iron Maiden has filled stadiums for forty years, moving some 85 million albums without the help of radio or television. Robert Greene's first book, The 48 Laws of Power, didn't hit the bestseller lists until over a decade after it was first released, and since then has sold more than 1 million copies worldwide. These works Ryan Holiday calls Perennial Sellers. They exist in every creative industry--timeless, dependable resources and unsung moneymakers, paying like blue chip annuities. Like gold or land, they increase in value over time, outlasting and outreaching any competition. And they're not flukes or lucky breaks--they were built to last from the outset. Holiday shows readers how to make and market their own classic work. Featuring interviews with some of the world's greatest creatives, and grounded in a deep study of the classics in every genre, this exciting new book empowers readers with a foundational set of innovative principles. Whether you have a book or a business, a song or the next great screenplay, this book reveals the recipe for perennial success.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","form-audiobook","sub-business-productivity"],"readDates":[["2020-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","2020-02-07T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":5,"pageCount":256,"dateRated":"2020-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2017-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2020-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Ryan Holiday","image":{"id":"21dc4f3a-ea0a-5634-81fb-1be2dcb8ff3a","childImageSharp":{"id":"29185d5f-2dbf-556d-9278-5a159005ecd7","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6625,"src":"/chareads.com/static/25bca42b4850a2ff9e6074b9ca795be8/97a55/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/25bca42b4850a2ff9e6074b9ca795be8/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/25bca42b4850a2ff9e6074b9ca795be8/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/25bca42b4850a2ff9e6074b9ca795be8/97a55/cover.jpg 265w","sizes":"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px"}}}},"html":"<p>How has it taken me so long to read this?
