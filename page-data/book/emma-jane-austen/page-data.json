Nothing, however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others. But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr Knightley and attempts to arrange a suitable match for her protegee Harriet Smith, her carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected. With its imperfect but charming heroine and its witty and subtle exploration of relationships, Emma is often seen as Jane Austen's most flawless work.\n","tags":["genre-pre-war-classic","type-fiction","form-paperback","genre-romance","book-club"],"readDates":[["2019-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","2019-08-21T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":2,"pageCount":486,"dateRated":"2019-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2012-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Jane Austen","image":{"id":"64df9acf-7c28-5a36-9ade-03cd1df9c265","childImageSharp":{"id":"74f5a638-4a9a-5a39-97f3-ba1bab1a750d","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6525,"src":"/chareads.com/static/61ade9e1b900286d4086676c42b29134/7a20b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/61ade9e1b900286d4086676c42b29134/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/61ade9e1b900286d4086676c42b29134/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/61ade9e1b900286d4086676c42b29134/7a20b/cover.jpg 261w","sizes":"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#D4D422","darkVibrant":"#727212","lightVibrant":"#BCC270","muted":"#8CACA4","darkMuted":"#848415","lightMuted":"#B0CCC4"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"5225ac94-59ba-5cf5-9c8e-6c1d32d7a627","title":"August Reviews","datePublished":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-09-august-reviews","viewCount":723},"timestamps":[{"t":16,"book":{"id":"a5ae62a4-11b0-5a4f-a319-b1cfd23d2ddc"}},{"t":255,"book":{"id":"0b6b9d69-ce1c-5be0-ad42-bd5a6513a72c"}},{"t":417,"book":{"id":"b1d2b3ee-fe61-570a-ba89-3bb8e18b8c1e"}}],"image":{"id":"7f2dd9dd-ece7-5bbf-936e-2d0ac51d8ff3","childImageSharp":{"id":"efd453d6-d8b4-5d58-816a-c9122ea81c15","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/4840d05aeb8148b99a404dd13734283a/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#6CC4F4","darkVibrant":"#A2942C","lightVibrant":"#81D4F5","muted":"#5C86A8","darkMuted":"#4F2C2D","lightMuted":"#ACB2C2"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0b6b9d69-ce1c-5be0-ad42-bd5a6513a72c"}}}
