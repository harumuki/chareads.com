While the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and readers throughout the centuries.\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","sub-philosophy","form-paperback","translated","sub-stoicism","pub-penguin-classics"],"readDates":[["2019-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","2019-05-19T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":null,"pageCount":303,"dateRated":null,"dateBookPublished":"2006-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Marcus Aurelius","image":{"id":"2e70268b-8d26-5c1a-b033-db808a759aad","childImageSharp":{"id":"0132754b-f2d2-57da-b421-51f389f882f5","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6511627906976745,"src":"/chareads.com/static/ee4ca41faeacf15246d276229dd6812f/f5783/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/ee4ca41faeacf15246d276229dd6812f/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/ee4ca41faeacf15246d276229dd6812f/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/ee4ca41faeacf15246d276229dd6812f/f5783/cover.jpg 280w","sizes":"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#8CBCCC","darkVibrant":"#041423","lightVibrant":"#BDD7E4","muted":"#A48464","darkMuted":"#604832","lightMuted":"#B5CED7"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"ef7d74aa-d318-5416-877c-b03bd8847324"}}}
