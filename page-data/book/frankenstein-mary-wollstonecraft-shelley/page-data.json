But his creature is a twisted, gruesome parody of a man who, rejected for his monstrous appearance, sets out to destroy his maker.\nMary Shelley's chilling Gothic tale, conceived after a nightmare in 1816 when she was only eighteen, became a modern myth. It is a disturbing and dramatic exploration of birth and death, creation and destruction, and one of the most iconic horror stories of all time.\n","tags":["genre-science-fiction","genre-pre-war-classic","type-fiction","form-ebook","pub-english-library"],"readDates":[["2017-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","2017-04-13T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":4,"pageCount":269,"dateRated":"2017-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2012-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":"2017-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley","image":{"id":"508fdd32-4407-5370-b7bf-cb6e923f023b","childImageSharp":{"id":"b97bd250-cf30-5b3f-8ad1-7e8dc81b4a96","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.5989974937343359,"src":"/chareads.com/static/f036c9933b0b40edfd28a74419beff60/025f4/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/f036c9933b0b40edfd28a74419beff60/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/f036c9933b0b40edfd28a74419beff60/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/f036c9933b0b40edfd28a74419beff60/025f4/cover.jpg 239w","sizes":"(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#4E6FB1","darkVibrant":"#293A5C","lightVibrant":"#D4DCEC","muted":"#97999E","darkMuted":"#2F436A","lightMuted":"#ACC4CE"}}},"html":"<p>I made a Frankenstein discussion video where I chatted about whether humans have gone too far, empathy and a sprinkle of feminism âœ¨</p>"},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9f460d92-4fce-5f8e-b34e-05b5c57dbc63"}}}
