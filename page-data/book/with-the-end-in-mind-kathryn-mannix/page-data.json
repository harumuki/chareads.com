She makes a compelling case for the therapeutic power of approaching death not with trepidation but with openness, clarity and understanding.\nWith the End in Mind is a book for us all: the grieving and bereaved, ill and healthy. Open these pages and you will find stories about people who are like you, and like people you know and love. You will meet Holly, who danced her last day away; Eric, the retired head teacher who, even with Motor Neurone Disease, gets things done; loving, tender-hearted Nelly and Joe, each living a lonely lie to save their beloved from distress; and Sylvie, 19, dying of leukaemia, sewing a cushion for her mum to hug by the fire after she has died.\nThese are just four of the book’s thirty-odd stories of normal humans, dying normal human deaths. They show how the dying embrace living not because they are unusual or brave, but because that’s what humans do. By turns touching, tragic, at times funny and always wise, they offer us illumination, models for action, and hope. Read this book and you’ll be better prepared for life as well as death.\n","tags":["genre-biography-memoir","type-non-fiction","sub-medical"],"readDates":[["2019-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","2019-03-22T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":4,"pageCount":null,"dateRated":"2019-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":null,"dateReviewed":null,"author":"Kathryn Mannix","image":{"id":"a9117422-732a-5e05-b279-16db87ab267b","childImageSharp":{"id":"38f8b2b6-8f41-553d-8544-699f70b36da9","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.6225,"src":"/chareads.com/static/c30e7d08331f5ec938b1ddd6bbabd5ac/5f486/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/c30e7d08331f5ec938b1ddd6bbabd5ac/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/c30e7d08331f5ec938b1ddd6bbabd5ac/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/c30e7d08331f5ec938b1ddd6bbabd5ac/5f486/cover.jpg 249w","sizes":"(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#DC4076","darkVibrant":"#7C143C","lightVibrant":"#EC749C","muted":"#98546B","darkMuted":"#634650","lightMuted":"#D7BFC8"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"97eb8009-1f75-59c5-9e10-56f513057e96","title":"March Reviews","datePublished":"2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-03-march-reviews","viewCount":809},"timestamps":[{"t":11,"book":{"id":"02d1704c-cb95-5b16-be29-e720089a60b4"}},{"t":204,"book":{"id":"b1da0472-11b7-59eb-bebc-e161cc6c9a15"}},{"t":340,"book":{"id":"050a1b4a-e267-5173-aed3-9e89acfc281a"}},{"t":485,"book":null},{"t":570,"book":{"id":"0418d1d0-0912-5af2-b732-f1c948236e33"}},{"t":756,"book":{"id":"51ff6345-c831-546c-bee6-80095ca2df58"}},{"t":936,"book":{"id":"3343cc95-016a-54a6-9f46-0accb99bc7f8"}},{"t":1025,"book":{"id":"c6dbd577-cdf0-5f41-b532-62d4659f60e1"}},{"t":1236,"book":{"id":"2d3ed929-39f4-50d5-b8b0-479a378beba0"}}],"image":{"id":"fac07c6d-f565-53bc-a363-0e327c30f97a","childImageSharp":{"id":"46ce50bf-c3bd-5ff1-ac08-a1cd852a588c","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/1fd3ce9227ae7fa129d8c21f2618b61f/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#BC673C","darkVibrant":"#733A2D","lightVibrant":"#D69CAC","muted":"#A66180","darkMuted":"#4C2F31","lightMuted":"#B0BBD4"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0418d1d0-0912-5af2-b732-f1c948236e33"}}}
