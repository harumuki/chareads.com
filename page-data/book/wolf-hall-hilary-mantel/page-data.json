If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell: a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people, and implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph?\n","tags":["type-non-fiction","form-audiobook","genre-historical-fiction"],"readDates":[["2019-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","2019-07-07T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":3,"pageCount":653,"dateRated":"2019-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Hilary Mantel","image":{"id":"37cfcdbd-b835-5216-8b0a-eb862216facc","childImageSharp":{"id":"415012ce-7273-5439-8b5a-1fa246776e40","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.655,"src":"/chareads.com/static/7758d5d22270a3b5dc0fc26e2e9af43c/7d99a/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/7758d5d22270a3b5dc0fc26e2e9af43c/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/7758d5d22270a3b5dc0fc26e2e9af43c/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/7758d5d22270a3b5dc0fc26e2e9af43c/7d99a/cover.jpg 262w","sizes":"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#B81E26","darkVibrant":"#641719","lightVibrant":"#D08484","muted":"#97424C","darkMuted":"#4E4C3D","lightMuted":"#D1BEB3"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"c108ee8f-8d0f-5a4f-a63e-e57957fa0b1a","title":"July Reviews","datePublished":"2019-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-08-july-reviews","viewCount":825},"timestamps":[{"t":7,"book":null},{"t":102,"book":{"id":"373448d3-f1f9-5725-8fc4-a9f5046986ed"}},{"t":373,"book":{"id":"60bd8373-6137-5c02-922b-d7fad59ec166"}},{"t":703,"book":{"id":"113a5eed-a0b9-5eb5-9240-acb3840032f0"}}],"image":{"id":"ffcb48bc-6fe8-507e-8bee-f9d4841be007","childImageSharp":{"id":"08283f4f-0934-525b-8cc1-b861afa5b83c","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/2aa239f9a530893748d1f7990e8b3e29/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/2aa239f9a530893748d1f7990e8b3e29/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/2aa239f9a530893748d1f7990e8b3e29/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/2aa239f9a530893748d1f7990e8b3e29/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/2aa239f9a530893748d1f7990e8b3e29/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/2aa239f9a530893748d1f7990e8b3e29/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/2aa239f9a530893748d1f7990e8b3e29/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#375AC6","darkVibrant":"#2C1514","lightVibrant":"#AACAF5","muted":"#9F567D","darkMuted":"#523337","lightMuted":"#D7AFB3"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113a5eed-a0b9-5eb5-9240-acb3840032f0"}}}
