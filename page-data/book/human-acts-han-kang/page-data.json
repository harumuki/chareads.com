In the wake of a viciously suppressed student uprising, a boy searches for his friend's corpse, a consciousness searches for its abandoned body, and a brutalised country searches for a voice. In a sequence of interconnected chapters the victims and the bereaved encounter censorship, denial, forgiveness and the echoing agony of the original trauma.\nHuman Acts is a universal book, utterly modern and profoundly timeless. Already a controversial bestseller and award-winning book in Korea, it confirms Han Kang as a writer of immense importance.\n","tags":["sub-history","gifted","type-fiction","form-paperback","genre-historical-fiction"],"readDates":[["2019-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","2019-12-15T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":4,"rating5":3,"pageCount":224,"dateRated":"2019-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2016-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Han Kang","image":{"id":"42b12f41-3c08-5373-bae2-eb0b23f5f5c9","childImageSharp":{"id":"8b62db40-4ab3-571c-95b3-561a36e061f1","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.615,"src":"/chareads.com/static/bb3a03b1958b5dca61ab01bb3a3f1045/0232d/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/bb3a03b1958b5dca61ab01bb3a3f1045/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/bb3a03b1958b5dca61ab01bb3a3f1045/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/bb3a03b1958b5dca61ab01bb3a3f1045/0232d/cover.jpg 246w","sizes":"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#217899","darkVibrant":"#18566D","lightVibrant":"#94C4CC","muted":"#6F8E97","darkMuted":"#69473B","lightMuted":"#ACC3C8"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"3dcd6ded-595c-5ce4-b62c-26edca2cff78","title":"December Wrap-Up","datePublished":"2020-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2020-01-december-wrap-up","viewCount":679},"timestamps":[{"t":45,"book":{"id":"566f026f-c5bd-5bed-9cd0-403144c1cfd5"}},{"t":262,"book":{"id":"94c352c6-c03b-5eca-aaa6-c237f8433014"}},{"t":530,"book":{"id":"9724961e-314a-5dcd-a554-33e3ccb84a6e"}}],"image":{"id":"76d5432e-e0a9-5b57-b675-c9f4529e9751","childImageSharp":{"id":"c81a8408-1362-5c24-b0cb-9f0e6b0d3b6e","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/359f74bb6a30b9baf5ef38c0ca47cf44/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/359f74bb6a30b9baf5ef38c0ca47cf44/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/359f74bb6a30b9baf5ef38c0ca47cf44/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/359f74bb6a30b9baf5ef38c0ca47cf44/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/359f74bb6a30b9baf5ef38c0ca47cf44/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/359f74bb6a30b9baf5ef38c0ca47cf44/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/359f74bb6a30b9baf5ef38c0ca47cf44/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#6270BB","darkVibrant":"#1E5484","lightVibrant":"#F4C0BF","muted":"#727B92","darkMuted":"#343A49","lightMuted":"#DBB7B8"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"566f026f-c5bd-5bed-9cd0-403144c1cfd5"}}}
