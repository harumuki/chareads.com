And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principal is playing by the rules.\nEnter Mia Warren - an enigmatic artist and single mother- who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons.\nSoon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.\nWhen old family friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town - and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at an unexpected and devastating costâ€¦\nThe brilliant new novel from the author of the New York Times bestseller, Everything I Never Told You.\n","tags":["genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2018-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","2018-11-19T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":5,"rating5":4,"pageCount":388,"dateRated":"2018-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":null,"dateReviewed":null,"author":"Celeste Ng","image":{"id":"9db47815-35c5-5a49-8b41-7e13ccb9a50f","childImageSharp":{"id":"a978f69f-d2ab-52a8-a2fc-7732528665ec","fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.635,"src":"/chareads.com/static/fc1679b5ef8efbdca5e5117675265239/e4fb9/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/fc1679b5ef8efbdca5e5117675265239/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/fc1679b5ef8efbdca5e5117675265239/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/fc1679b5ef8efbdca5e5117675265239/e4fb9/cover.jpg 254w","sizes":"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#04A8A8","darkVibrant":"#0B737C","lightVibrant":"#B9DCE0","muted":"#60AAA9","darkMuted":"#374E5F","lightMuted":"#B6C5B5"}}},"html":""},"timestampMentionData":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"8678bebb-ac42-5f90-a1a2-7fbc6b450633","title":"33 Book Reviews","datePublished":"2019-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"slug":"/video/2019-03-33-book-reviews","viewCount":1572},"timestamps":[{"t":78,"book":{"id":"b5fe70fd-ed14-50b8-80e0-e6db20601a67"}},{"t":125,"book":null},{"t":150,"book":{"id":"43ce85f9-c6e3-5b2a-bcb0-33eb7713c915"}},{"t":171,"book":{"id":"051066fe-5835-5a75-b21d-a55b4818fc8c"}},{"t":299,"book":{"id":"daa16512-2aca-59da-9969-6bb709b2b062"}},{"t":386,"book":{"id":"31e13483-b155-5c30-a587-e094ce60c3ca"}},{"t":465,"book":{"id":"66f87cba-5dbc-5b0c-a0a7-2c831ff9aa51"}},{"t":548,"book":{"id":"b0577604-f211-5926-8595-d3ff86f5df5c"}},{"t":621,"book":{"id":"d20f4a5f-2661-50b2-87d2-cdf55cf41e6a"}},{"t":648,"book":null},{"t":708,"book":{"id":"b1d2b3ee-fe61-570a-ba89-3bb8e18b8c1e"}},{"t":880,"book":null},{"t":955,"book":{"id":"87c58dcf-9323-5899-8729-af0295b12b41"}},{"t":980,"book":{"id":"efa156cd-b54b-5932-bade-0ede5ec248da"}},{"t":1095,"book":{"id":"cdc2c507-d384-52d2-adbe-0bb03bb2b635"}},{"t":1212,"book":{"id":"80a6e125-a89a-5882-b64f-d81ea3f4b259"}},{"t":1368,"book":{"id":"4bbb46fe-9dc3-5436-8d0b-627650d37501"}},{"t":1449,"book":{"id":"8a14becf-0353-5ddc-9a1a-75a2ba66d1f0"}},{"t":1579,"book":{"id":"cdcc1b2c-3f71-5c03-bb70-264f0c9a27c8"}},{"t":1655,"book":{"id":"330900b9-9421-5068-9aa0-e5ad79e40480"}},{"t":1715,"book":{"id":"1e08e04b-d63c-54fa-891b-3c742461ea11"}},{"t":1795,"book":{"id":"7085fc31-ff01-506c-b459-2d7a3e62639d"}},{"t":1829,"book":null},{"t":1913,"book":{"id":"1adb5115-a7f0-51f8-8910-2b11307a604c"}},{"t":1974,"book":null},{"t":2106,"book":{"id":"88938e06-0394-53b4-8e0e-47635bf7f892"}},{"t":2311,"book":null},{"t":2556,"book":{"id":"d7d2b03c-aa29-5ee2-b222-16ebbe4ba0ff"}},{"t":2545,"book":{"id":"0e3b0150-7f4e-5dcd-8e82-c932dbfc9528"}},{"t":2784,"book":{"id":"35a86c1b-32e4-5ae1-8c44-a2f5a01652c2"}},{"t":2868,"book":{"id":"0cb3a5ee-8217-5efa-96bb-2db9feba2900"}}],"image":{"id":"4e91d5b6-fc17-5e48-8a8e-ec923157917d","childImageSharp":{"id":"90d35327-888f-5cf8-b0f6-fd7cd22abe65","fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/00333/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/d8819/cover.jpg 50w,\n/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/4c7fd/cover.jpg 100w,\n/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/00333/cover.jpg 200w,\n/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/2503d/cover.jpg 300w,\n/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/c2a2a/cover.jpg 400w,\n/chareads.com/static/17135f7ae5722adb1cf74f492e0eb787/e2de3/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#E15C60","darkVibrant":"#552E11","lightVibrant":"#EB8385","muted":"#8F776F","darkMuted":"#5D3F35","lightMuted":"#9DC2D1"}}}}]},"featuredVideoData":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1adb5115-a7f0-51f8-8910-2b11307a604c"}}}
