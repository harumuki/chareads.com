I was watching a video by Raeleen (padfootandprongs07) about book buying and guilt - <a href=\"http://youtu.be/W8fyhNSWMZo\">http://youtu.be/W8fyhNSWMZo</a> - which you should totally watch because it’s great, and I started to feel quite guilty about this video. I buy a lot of books that I do want to read, but often it’s a ‘some day’ and not a ‘right now’ thing, and that sucks. Then they’re just there growing dust, and that sucks.</p>","quote":null,"datePublished":"2014-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","viewCount":5418,"timestamps":null,"image":{"id":"73a312c1-c803-5b4b-8111-b58bbf967215","colors":{"vibrant":"#4C8CC4","darkVibrant":"#65303F","lightVibrant":"#FAD48C","muted":"#BE8F83","darkMuted":"#3A3657","lightMuted":"#BAB9C2"}},"ownedBy":null,"relatedBooks":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"acf5d1df-7960-55b8-822c-73f7cdcb13b5-video"}}}
