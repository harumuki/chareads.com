I was watching a video by Raeleen (padfootandprongs07) about book buying and guilt - http://youtu.be/W8fyhNSWMZo - which you should totally watch because it's great, and I started to feel quite guilty about this video. I buy a lot of books that I do want to read, but often it's a 'some day' and not a 'right now' thing, and that sucks. Then they're just there growing dust, and that sucks.\n","quote":null,"datePublished":"2014-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","fields":{"viewCount":5412},"timestamps":null,"image":{"id":"73a312c1-c803-5b4b-8111-b58bbf967215","colors":{"vibrant":"#4C8CC4","darkVibrant":"#65303F","lightVibrant":"#FAD48C","muted":"#BE8F83","darkMuted":"#3A3657","lightMuted":"#BAB9C2"}},"ownedBy":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"2592ed34-142b-5640-87ae-28d9ea76b404"}}}
