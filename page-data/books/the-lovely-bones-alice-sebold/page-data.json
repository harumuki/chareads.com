Upsetting, you say? Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.\nThe details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school. Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed. But what the reader knows, her family does not. Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.\nSebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some. But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part. To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.\n","tags":["genre-young-adult","genre-contemporary","type-fiction","form-paperback"],"readDates":[["2009-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"]],"rating7":null,"rating5":2,"pageCount":372,"dateRated":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateBookPublished":"2006-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","dateReviewed":null,"author":"Alice Sebold","publisher":"Little, Brown and Company","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"af30b871-0e83-51b9-ac4b-2a75b9c90d9d","childImageSharp":{"id":"1a60b587-5dab-51dd-842b-541dd7112595","h200":{"width":131,"height":200,"src":"/static/07f0389c8adec2ecc57498b990bfb235/b3dc8/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/07f0389c8adec2ecc57498b990bfb235/b3dc8/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/07f0389c8adec2ecc57498b990bfb235/02d26/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/07f0389c8adec2ecc57498b990bfb235/a98b0/cover.jpg 2x"},"h300":{"width":197,"height":300,"src":"/static/07f0389c8adec2ecc57498b990bfb235/02d26/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/07f0389c8adec2ecc57498b990bfb235/02d26/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/07f0389c8adec2ecc57498b990bfb235/f2a7d/cover.jpg 1.5x"},"h400":{"width":263,"height":400,"src":"/static/07f0389c8adec2ecc57498b990bfb235/a98b0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/07f0389c8adec2ecc57498b990bfb235/a98b0/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#079FFB","darkVibrant":"#0456B8","lightVibrant":"#80E9FA","muted":"#6C9C9C","darkMuted":"#457D9B","lightMuted":"#92C9CA"}},"html":"","relatedBooks":[{"id":"76cfc608-1e73-58be-ae39-c60775d396a3-book","slug":"/books/crudo-olivia-laing","title":"Crudo","author":"Olivia Laing","rating7":2,"dateReviewed":"2020-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"dd3d8922-d8d3-5a11-b30c-4f4052e6df73","childImageSharp":{"id":"fc0bf799-1ffe-59b8-a0d8-2c2a11be7955","h150":{"width":98,"height":150,"src":"/static/33f041a20868560c05a73077716ad6a8/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/33f041a20868560c05a73077716ad6a8/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/33f041a20868560c05a73077716ad6a8/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/33f041a20868560c05a73077716ad6a8/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":228,"height":350,"src":"/static/33f041a20868560c05a73077716ad6a8/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/33f041a20868560c05a73077716ad6a8/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#17AEB9","darkVibrant":"#0F6F76","lightVibrant":"#A4DCEC","muted":"#52ACAC","darkMuted":"#744040","lightMuted":"#C29195"}},"video":null},{"id":"e9aee48b-c410-5a16-8d26-b7f4e1a4b4bd-book","slug":"/books/an-american-marriage-tayari-jones","title":"An American Marriage","author":"Tayari Jones","rating7":3,"dateReviewed":null,"bookHeight":198,"image":{"id":"ab25de45-c43d-5aa6-a863-afd4e0f90b05","childImageSharp":{"id":"5599b354-7915-5be3-9795-0b4488dce1ba","h150":{"width":98,"height":150,"src":"/static/fd8fe159fb16348063d964b93807c705/56830/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fd8fe159fb16348063d964b93807c705/56830/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/fd8fe159fb16348063d964b93807c705/c662b/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/fd8fe159fb16348063d964b93807c705/02d26/cover.jpg 2x"},"h350":{"width":228,"height":350,"src":"/static/fd8fe159fb16348063d964b93807c705/76e49/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fd8fe159fb16348063d964b93807c705/76e49/cover.jpg 1x"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#E47414","darkVibrant":"#683B1E","lightVibrant":"#E4A96E","muted":"#549CAC","darkMuted":"#284851","lightMuted":"#EAEBE4"}},"video":{"id":"57211544-3a3f-5c5c-81fb-94b508be2e8a-video","slug":"/videos/2020-02-an-american-marriage-tayari-jones"}},{"id":"094d8189-0f50-57e7-9de8-b7753bfd78aa-book","slug":"/books/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-jk-rowling","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","author":"J.K.
